                        <h3>Thursday night Preview Bills vs. Jets</h3>
                        <p>November 1st, 2017 Thomas Baker</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Well, just as everyone expected, it's week 9 and the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills have combined for an 8-7 record.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">
                        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#exampleAccordion" href="#readBlog19" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="readBlog19">Read Blog</a>
                        <div id="readBlog19" class="collapse" role="tabpanel">
                            <p>
                                I'm sure everyone was banking on the Jets having a 3 game win streak, and the Bills being a half game out from the best record in the AFC this far into the season as well. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Bills are coming off a nice 34-14 win over the <strong>Oakland Raiders</strong> while the Jets lost a heartbreaker to the <strong>Atlanta Falcons</strong>, 25-20. With the Bills upcoming schedule and the Jets sitting at 3-5, this is a game that both teams desperately need. 
                            </p>
                                <h1>Start Them</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>LESEAN MCCOY</strong> - has averaged 121 yards and 1.5 touchdowns a game since the Bills week 6 bye. And if that's good enough, hes also averaging 5.5 receptions over that timespan. Granted, that was to the Buccaneers and Raiders, but the Jets defense ranks even lower(27th) than they do against the run. McCoy is a must start RB1 this week. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>ROBBY ANDERSON</strong> - set a career high for receptions(6) and yards(104) last week, and has scored a touchdown his last two weeks. It's clear he's become <strong>Josh McCown's</strong> favorite target, and against a Bills defense that is giving up the 10th most yards per game, he should be able to put up some decent numbers. Especially, if the Jets get down early. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>AUSTIN SEFERIAN-JENKINS</strong> - ranks 9th in targets and 3rd in receptions among tight ends. He has a higher ceiling in PPR leagues, but should be able to get some production against this Bills defense, which is giving up the 9th most points to tight ends. 
                                </p>
                                 <h1>Sit Them</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>JOSH MCCOWN</strong> - has completed 60% of his passes the last 8 games, which is the longest streak in all the NFL. He's also put up at least 18 points the last 3 weeks. However, the Bills have given up the 4th fewest points to signal callers this year, including holding McCown to 187 yards passing and 2 interceptions week 1.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>JERMAINE KEARSE</strong> - has been a top 25 wide receiver for most of 2017. But with the return of ASJ and the emergence of Robby Anderson, Kearse has found his role in this offense diminish weekly. Over the last 2 weeks, Kearse has 3 receptions for 43 yards. <strong>Ricardo Lewis</strong> of the Browns has 5 receptions for 63 yards over that span. Kearse owners may want to start looking for other avenues if he's still taking up a roster spot. Hey, Ricardo Lewis is only owned in 2% of ESPN leagues. Problem solved.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     <strong>BILAL POWELL</strong> - Over the last 2 weeks, Bilal Powell has toted the rock 23 times for 76 yards. His fantasy value has also taken a hit thanks to the return of Matt Forte. With Forte resuming 3rd down and passing reps, and the Bills allowing the 9th fewest points to opposing RB's in standard PPR leagues, Powell should be no more than a desperation flex play in 24 team leagues. 
                                </p>
                                <h1>Sneaky Picks</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>MATT FORTE</strong> - A sneaky pick? Yes. Let's face it, we're not dealing with the 2012 Matt Forte that can do it all. Over the last 3 weeks, he's carried the ball 20 times for 70 yards. But, he's also caught 19 passes for 145 yards. He's, obviously, a much stronger PPR league play, but he's always a threat to find paydirt catching the ball out of the backfield.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>ANDRE HOLMES</strong> - is coming off a strong performance against the Raiders, catching 3 balls for 51 yards and a touchdown. Although that might not seem like much, he led all WRs in receptions, yards and hauled in the only touchdown pass. With opposing teams focusing on <strong>Zay Jones</strong> and <strong>Jordan Matthews</strong>, Holmes may be able to keep logging decent fantasy days.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On paper, the Bills should be able to run the ball down the Jets throat and win this game by 3 scores. But, I went against my gut last week and it worked out just fine. 
                                </p>
                                <p>

                        <h3>Thursday night Preview Dolphins vs. Ravens</h3>
                        <p>October 26th, 2017 Thomas Baker</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>If you're a person who hates offense, then be sure you're in front of your tv Thursday night. The red- hot <strong>Miami Dolphins</strong> take on the flailing <strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong>, in what promises to be a defensive battle.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">
                        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#exampleAccordion" href="#readBlog18" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="readBlog18">Read Blog</a>
                        <div id="readBlog18" class="collapse" role="tabpanel">
                            <p>
                                Despite their 3 game win streak, the Dolphins sport the league’s worst offense averaging under 262 yards a game. The Ravens, losers of 4 of their last 5, come in just ahead of them with 277 yards a game, good for second worst in the league.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, without further ado, let's try and find a few needles in this Thursday night haystack.
                            </p>
                                <h1>Start Them</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>JAVORIOUS ALLEN</strong> - is averaging over 5 receptions a game since week 2, including 8 last week. With the Ravens wide receiver corp decimated with injuries, I look for Allen to play a major part in the passing game. He's sure to lose some touches to a surging <strong>Alex Collins</strong>, but I think Allen leads the way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>JARVIS LANDRY</strong> - In the 2 games since <strong>Davante Parker's</strong> injury, <strong>Jarvis Landry</strong> has 15 receptions for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns. That's a good chunk of the team's average yards a game. The Ravens defense looks good on paper, having forced 15 turnovers this year, but 10 of those came in their first two games. Look for Landry to build on this momentum Thursday night.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>JAY AJAYI</strong> - For fantasy owners that took <strong>Jay Ajayi</strong> in the first couple rounds of their fantasy drafts, you've been rewarded thus far with 442 yards and 0 touchdowns. But with the injury to <strong>Jay Cutler</strong> and the Ravens getting a chance to game plan against <strong>Matt Moore</strong>, I look for the Dolphins to lean on Ajayi. And, who knows? <strong>Amari Cooper</strong> was able to breakout last Thursday night, maybe Ajayi can follow suit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>KENNY STILLS</strong> - I don’t know what it is about <strong>Kenny Stills</strong>, but Matt Moore loves him. Stills brought in a touchdown reception in all 3 of Moore’s starts last year and grabbed 2 td’s this past Sunday from him. The speedster could be a nice DFS play or streaming option until Cutler returns.
                                </p>
                                 <h1>Sit Them</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>JOE FLACCO</strong> - I wanted to put "EVERYONE ELSE" here, but I'm told that would not look very professional. So we'll start with the most obvious sit them. <strong>Joe Flacco</strong> has been absolute butt. He's yet to throw for over 235 yards in a game, has scored double digit points in only 2 contests, and has 3 more interceptions than touchdowns. He was benched this year in a game against the Jaguars after going 8 for18 for 28 yards and 2 interceptions. He should remain on your bench, even if your league plays 3 quarterbacks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>MATT MOORE</strong> - took over for an injured <strong>Jay Cutler</strong> and performed admirably, completing 18 of 21 passes for 188 yards and 2 touchdowns to only 1 interception. That being said, the Jets had game planned for Cutler all week, but the Ravens will be game planning for Moore. Even though the Ravens interception rate, which is the best in the league, is buoyed by their output their first 2 games, they're still allowing the 3rd lowest passer rating to quarterbacks. And there's a reason Moore wasn't starting. Cutler wasn't exactly lighting the world on fire either.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Sneaky Picks</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>CHRIS MOORE</strong> - was targeted 8 times against the Vikings and brought in his first career touchdown reception. With the Ravens reeling at receiver, he could put up a repeat performance, especially with that kind of volume.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>BEN WATSON</strong> - I know <strong>Ben Watson</strong> hasn’t put up double digit fantasy points since week 3, but the Dolphins defense is allowing the league’s highest catch rate to tight ends this season. And I hate to harp on it, but the Ravens have no wide receivers. They plucked <strong>Griff Whalen</strong> off the street last week and then threw it to him 6 times. Watson could have a heavy workload Thursday.

                                    My gut is telling me that the Dolphins should be able to win this game easily, but my gut is also very hungry. Ravens defense/special teams allow <strong>Justin Tucker</strong> to do his thing and are able to get back on track Thursday night.

                        <h3>Week 7 Lessons Learned</h3>
                        <p>October 24th, 2017 Marcel Hull</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Week 7 was a beautiful disaster for fantasy owners, with some surprising performances, some welcome bounce back performances, and of course more injuries. We will take a deep dive into these as the season keeps rolling into week 8.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">

                            <h1>Positive Takeaways</h1>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Carson Wentz</strong> and <strong>Dak Prescott</strong> are incredible. In just their second seasons respectively, they are putting up gaudy numbers (17 TDs, 4 INTs for Wentz; 14 TDs, 4 INTs for Prescott) and have looked like superstars doing it. They are both surefire QB1s weekly and have me excited for the future of this league.
                                <p>
                                   With Aaron Rodgers going down for the season, many fantasy owners were left pondering what the RB situation would be like now in Green Bay. If Sunday is any indication, <strong>Aaron Jones</strong> is now the guy. The first-year runner had 17 carries for 131 yards and a TD against the Saints, while <strong>Ty Montgomery</strong> saw 4 carries and registered 6 yards. This was the worry with Montgomery as he is a converted wide receiver, and we have possibly seen his time as a starting tailback come to an end. I need to see one more solid game from Jones this week to solidify his role as a weekly play for me though, but that will have to wait as the Packers are on bye in week 8. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was a welcome sight to see <strong>Julio Jones</strong> (9 rec, 99 yards, 1 TD) and <strong>Doug Baldwin</strong> (9 rec, 92 yards, 1 TD) bounce back from sluggish starts on Sunday. The targets are there for these studs, and a big second half could be coming for both. <strong>Amari Cooper</strong> had the biggest bounce back though with 210 yards, 2 TDs on 19 targets. That’s how you get your stud back on track. He did have a couple of drops though, and with a tough matchup in week 8 at Buffalo, I am reserving judgment on pronouncing Cooper as all the way back until I see more consistency.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Nelson Agholor</strong> reached the end zone once again for the third straight week, and now has 5 for the season. While the targets still are not where I would like them to be when relying on a receiver (5 targets in week 7), He is producing like a solid WR3. Playing in a high-powered offense, Agholor could continue crossing the end zone on a consistent basis moving forward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the fourth straight week, <strong>Hunter Henry</strong> finished as a top-8 TE and appears to have finally gotten the torch passed to him from Antonio Gates. Averaging 82 YPG over his past 2 weeks, Henry is now a weekly starter in my eyes, and could have a big week 8 as the Chargers have a matchup with New England on Sunday afternoon. 
                                </p>
                                <h1>Negative Takeaways</h1>
                                <p>
                                    Well <strong>Cam Newton</strong>, that was rough. 211 yards, 2 INTs, 1 fumble, and 0 TDs against the Bears is not what fantasy owners were expecting, especially from a guy averaging 26 FPPG over his previous 3 weeks. This is what you get with Cam from time to time, and owners will just have to live with the inconsistencies and bad weeks as the big weeks will still be there with the Auburn product. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   What a difference a week makes for <strong>Adrian Peterson</strong>. Just last week, AP had 120 yards and 2 TDs and the Cardinals offense was looking potent once again. Against the Rams though everything that could have gone wrong did. Peterson had 11 carries for 21 yards, and more importantly lost his starting quarterback in Carson Palmer for the season due to a broken arm. Many will still view Peterson as an RB2 for the rest of the season, but in a bad offense with low scoring potential I see Peterson as an RB3/Flex play at best.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I discussed last week on Twitter that I am staying away from the Patriots RBs even though <strong>Dion Lewis</strong> is the best runner there by far because no one back has consistent usage week in and week out (except White in PPR). This week perfectly exemplified that as 31 backfield carries were dispersed amongst the 4 backs (13 for Lewis, 8 for Gillislee, 6 for Burkhead, and 4 for White). This is what I predict most weeks will look like for New England, and I would rather take higher upside chances on guys like McKinnon, Mack, or Duke Johnson.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you were still holding out hope for <strong>Terrelle Pryor</strong>, that’s done. Outside of a 70 yard &amp; 1 TD game against KC in week 4 he has been awful, only topping 35 yards once. On top of the poor production, his snap count dwindled to only 30 snaps in week 7 while <strong>Josh Doctson</strong> reached 54 snaps respectively. It appears the Redskins are moving on from Pryor as their primary deep threat and seeing what they have in Doctson. I think Pryor can be dropped in all leagues, and is probably the frontrunner for bust of the year. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After blowing up for 175 yards in week 5 at Detroit, <strong>Ed Dickson</strong> has produced games of 36 and 18 yards against the Eagles and Bears sequentially. As we said on the podcast, track record says everything for Dickson, and those who thought he could possibly replace the Greg Olsen production are now going back to the drawing board. There are only about 7 or 8 Tight Ends you can rely on weekly, everyone else is just a weekly dart throw.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Player to Watch</h1>
                                <p>
                                    With the debacle that <strong>Martavis Bryant</strong> is currently going through in Pittsburgh and his departure seeming inevitable at this point, I think <strong>JuJu Smith-Schuster</strong> is absolutely someone to keep an eye one moving forward. If Bryant leaves town for good, Smith-Schuster will immediately be locked in as the No. 2 WR behind AB, and with Big Ben showing signs of improvement, could be valuable down the stretch. Talking with NFL Network’s Marcas Grant, he doesn’t view him as a weekly option if that happens but sees him as a great stash. I tend to agree with him, and he is my number one waiver pickup this week as the talent and upside are definitely there for the rookie out of USC.

                        <p>Both, the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders, will look to rebound this Thursday night, after suffering two disheartening losses.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">
                        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#exampleAccordion" href="#readBlog16" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="readBlog16">Read Blog</a>

                            The Raiders lost to the, previously winless, L.A. Chargers while the Chiefs lost at home to the Pittsburgh Steelers, allowing the 1972 Dolphins to pop that champagne.
                           </p>
                            <p>
                                While there are only 2 teams on bye this week, some of you will have to do without the likes of Deshaun Watson, Matthew Stafford, and Deandre Hopkins, who is having a nice bounce back season after last years dud. With Chacandrick West and Tyreek Hill both leaving Sunday's game with concussions, this game may be able to get you through to the other side.
                            </p>
                            <h1>START THEM</h1>
                            <p>
                                <strong>KAREEM HUNT</strong> -  became the first player in the Super Bowl era to amass 100 yards from scrimmage in each of his first 6 games. It's not hard to believe that he's fantasy's #1 RB in standard ppr formats.Against a Raiders defense who is giving up 117 yards a game to running backs, Hunt is a must start. I'd have him starting against the '85 Bears defense.
                            </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>ALEX SMITH</strong> - Who would've thought 8 years ago that we would consider 246 yards and a touchdown an "off game" for <strong>Alex Smith</strong>? Well, that's where we are. Smith is fantasy's 2nd ranked QB, having tossed 12 touchdowns and 0 interceptions. Oakland is giving up 232 yards passing a game, and this is a team that has faced the likes of <strong>Trevor Siemian, Josh McCown</strong> and <strong>Joe Flacco</strong>. Look for Alex Smith to bounce back in a big way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>TRAVIS KELCE</strong> - is coming off a disappointing 4 catch 37 yards performance against the Steelers. Even so, he's already hauled in 33 passes in 6 games this season and is Alex Smith's top target. Going against an Oakland defense that has given up the 11th most yards to tight ends this season, I expect Kelce to be a nice TE1 this week.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>MICHAEL CRABTREE</strong> - I'm not going to sugar coat things. The Raiders offense has been, what some might call, "butt". They've failed to top 20 points in a game for a month. With that being said, the ball has to go somewhere, and that somewhere has been <strong>Michael Crabtree</strong>. Over the last 2 weeks, Crabtree has caught 12 passes for 134 yards and 2 touchdowns. In a game where I suspect the Raiders will have to throw the ball a lot, look for Crabtree to be in that WR2 range with WR1 upside.
                                </p>
                                <h1>SIT THEM</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>MARSHAWN LYNCH</strong> - has not turned out to be the savior the Raiders were hoping for. Averaging 3.6 yards per carry, Beast Mode has yet to break a run for over 15 yards this season. The Chiefs defense was just shredded by Leveon Bell for 179 yards, but that was also on 32 carries. Even so, Lynch is no Bell.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>DEREK CARR</strong> - returned from his transverse process fracture(hurt back), but didn't play quite as well as anyone had hoped. He did complete 21 of 30 passes, but also completed 2 more to the Chargers. In his 2 games prior to his injury, Carr still failed to hit the 150 yard passing mark. Granted, he left in the 3rd quarter 2 weeks ago, but nonetheless, he hasn't completed a pass for more than 15 yards his last 3 starts. Until I see a complete game out of Carr, I'm not starting him unless I absolutely have to.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Poor <strong>AMARI COOPER</strong> owners. Typically taken within the first 2 rounds of fantasy drafts, Cooper has rewarded owners with 1 double digit fantasy effort. That's the same amount as the Browns <strong>Rashard Higgins</strong>. Currently the 71st ranked WR in ppr formats, I'm finding other venues at WR until he shows some signs of life.
                                </p>
                                <h1>SNEAKY PICKS</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>CORDARRELLE PATTERSON</strong> - has been a spark plug, of sorts, for the Raiders. The University of Tennessee product is listed as a WR, but he's done his damage as a RB. Patterson has rushed for over 50 yards and a touchdown in 2 games this season, including Sunday when he rushed for 55 yards rushing and a touchdown, to go along with a reception for 6 yards. If you're in a spot this week, Patterson is a high risk, high reward prospect.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With <strong>Chacandrick West</strong> and <strong>Albert Wilson</strong> unlikely to play, and Chris Conley lost for the season, <strong>DE'ANTHONY THOMAS</strong> could make for a decent play this week. He turned 3 catches into 61 yards and a touchdown last week, which was his second straight game with a touchdown. Even though the Raiders are giving up the 8th fewset points to WRs this year, Thomas' big play ability should not be overlooked.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Raiders have won their last 3 primetime games in the Coliseum. Still, that was with a healthy David Carr and a semblance of a run game. The Chiefs will be looking to get back on track and have already proven they can go on the road and win on Thursday night.

                        <h3>Week 6 Lessons Learned</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>Week 6 in the NFL was one that included a lot of big time injuries, surprising blowups, and shocking upsets.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">

                                These brought about many lessons to take away for fantasy purposes, and these will be discussed further in depth to help owners as we approach the halfway point of many fantasy leagues.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Kirk Cousins</strong> finished as the QB-1 in week 6, and in my opinion has now cemented himself as a top-5 every week QB starter going forward (3 straight 20+ point scoring outputs). Jordan Reed is getting healthy which only helps Captain Kirk, and Chris Thompson is possibly the most dynamic pass-catching back going right now. Start Cousins with confidence.
                                <p>
                                   This year has sucked for injuries, that’s the best way I could put it. With <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong> now seemingly out for the season with a broken collarbone, many fantasy owners are reeling looking for a replacement. <strong>Brett Hundley</strong> should be OK but I wouldn’t be excited if I were a Green Bay fan or Rodgers owner. Some interesting replacements include <strong>Jacoby Brissett</strong>, <strong>Josh McCown</strong>, and <strong>Carson Palmer</strong>, but you are probably better served streaming positive matchups.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On the podcast this past Thursday, I mentioned we didn’t need to talk about <strong>Adrian Peterson</strong> going to the Cardinals. Well…. better late than never right? AD looked great on Sunday, immediately being thrust into a workhorse role and producing 134 yards rushing and 2 TD’s. I think this provides an interesting opportunity to see if you can get a high-end player in a package with AP (<strong>LeSean McCoy</strong> or <strong>Julio Jones</strong> for example), but I completely understand if you want to ride this out. He should do well again next week in a matchup on the road against the Rams.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On the other side of the Peterson trade, <strong>Mark Ingram</strong> was finally freed and exploded for 114 yards rushing, 36 yards receiving on 5 catches ,and 2 TDs against the Lions. He is now a high-end RB2, possible low-end RB1 going forward and owners who were patient or bought low on the Alabama product are now reaping those rewards.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After fumbling in the first half against the Jets on Sunday afternoon, <strong>Mike Gillislee</strong> got Belicheck’d (benched until late in the fourth quarter). <strong>Dion Lewis</strong> came in and was explosive while getting into the end zone. We have seen this before with New England, and I am honestly staying away from everyone in that backfield aside from <strong>James White</strong> in PPR.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Golden Tate</strong> had an awesome day on Sunday with 96 yards and a TD on 7 catches, but unfortunately went down with a shoulder injury late and is expected to miss a few weeks. This opens the door for <strong>Marvin Jones Jr.</strong> (96 yards and a TD himself on Sunday) who has seen his production increase each week. I think he is a solid flex play and possible WR2 while Tate is out, and the schedule looks pretty nice during that time (vs PITT, @ GB, vs CLE).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   With Aaron Rodgers out for the year, the only players I like in that Green Bay receiving core are <strong>Jordy Nelson</strong> and <strong>Davante Adams</strong>. Nelson should have the targets to still warrant WR1 consideration and Adams will be targeted enough in the red zone to produce, but I am perfectly fine with you dropping <strong>Randall Cobb</strong> (29 yards in week 6) and <strong>Martellus Bennett</strong> (22 yards in week 6). I am also benching the RB’s, as <strong>Ty Montgomery</strong> and <strong>Aaron Jones</strong> split carries and basically cancel each other out for fantasy purposes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As we predicted, <strong>Evan Engram</strong> was the biggest beneficiary of all of the unfortunate injuries in that Giants receiving core (82 yards, 1 TD). He is a weekly TE1 now and the only guys I like ahead of him ROS are: Gronkowski, Ertz, Kelce, ASJ, and Cameron Brate. I am starting Engram with confidence moving forward.

                        <h3>Thursday Night Preview: Eagles at Panthers</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>The Eagles meet the Panthers Thursday night in Charlotte, in what might possibly be a prequel to the NFC Championship game.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">
                        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#exampleAccordion" href="#readBlog14" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="readBlog14">Read Blog</a>

                                After posting wins over the defending Super Bowl Champion, New England Patriots, and a Detroit Lions team, whose defense was tied for the league lead in turnovers, the Panthers set their sites on a Philadelphia Eagles squad that is coming off an impressive win of their own.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It wasn't so much the team the Eagles beat, as it was how they beat them. <strong>Carson Wentz</strong> threw for over 300 yards and 4 scores as the Eagles routed the Arizona Cardinals 34-7. I don't expect the Eagles to have that kind of outing Thursday night, but we'll get to that later.
                            </p>
                                <p>
                                    Going into the second real week of byes, some of you may be looking for some help to account for the likes of Ezekiel Elliott or A.J. Green. If so, this game could be a nice stop gap with the players involved.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Start Them</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>CAM NEWTON</strong> - As you've probably heard 8 dozen times since Sunday, Cam Newton had his first back to back, 300 yard passing games since his first two career starts. Against an Eagles defense that has given up the 10th most fantasy points to quarterbacks, I like his chances at a third. The Eagles pass rush and run defense are fierce, but if anyone can elude them it's Superman. Newton is a surefire QB1 for this week
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Devin Funchess</strong> - You'll want to keep an eye on Devin Funchess as he has been held out of practice with an undisclosed knee injury, but head coach Ron Rivera doesn't seemed worried, so neither should you. The Panthers were dealt quite a blow when pro bowl tight end Greg Olsen was lost for the season with a Jones fracture, but Funchess has been a beacon of hope. Since Olsen went down week 2, Funchess has recorded 18 receptions for 181 yards and 3 scores. I look for him to continue his success against this Philadelphia D. Funchess is a WR2 this week with WR1 upside.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>KELVIN BENJAMIN</strong> - Seeing a theme? I just don't see the Eagles secondary having an answer for Cam and his playmakers. If I had to choose, I'd take Funchess but I'm not limiting myself if I don't have to.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>WENDELL SMALLWOOD</strong> - Again, you'll want to keep an eye on the injury report with a quick turnaround game and him being inactive last week but, if he plays, Wendell Smallwood could have a breakout game. Especially, if Lane Johnson is inactive, which it looks like he will be. More on that later. If Wentz is not afforded the time in the pocket he needs, we could be looking at check down central. Population:Wendell Smallwood. Solid flex play if active.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>ZACH ERTZ</strong> - He's the number 1 scorer amongst fantasy tight ends. I shouldn't even have to mention him.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>ALSHON JEFFERY</strong> - Being the Eagles only true deep threat, defenses have been able to key in on Alshon Jeffrey this year. In doing so, they’ve been limiting him to just 4 catches and 49 yards a game. And let’s face it, matchups against the likes of Janoris Jenkins, Josh Norman and Patrick Peterson are rarely fruitful. But with Carolina’s top two corners (Daryl Worley, James Bradberry) banged up and possibly out Thursday, I think Jeffrey could be in for a big day. Consider him a WR2.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Sit Them</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>CARSON WENTZ</strong> - As I eluded to earlier, Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson is likely to miss Thursday night's game, as he has been unable to pass all 317 tests of the leagues concussion protocol. No big deal, right?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Wrong.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since the beginning of the 2016 season, the Eagles are 9-2 when Johnson plays and just 2-11 when he does not. In those games, Wentz has thrown for 16 tds to only 4 int's. That means he's gone for 10 tds and 13 int's when Johnson does not play. Wentz may return to rookie form in Charlotte.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>LEGARETTE BLOUNT</strong> - It's hard to say that Legarrette Blount has been a disappointment this year, seeing how expectations were so tempered going in. No way would he replicate his top 10 rb performance from a year ago, but maybe he could have a few nice games to get fantasy owners excited. And, to his credit, he's rattled off 3 double digit point games in 5 weeks. Unfortunately, I don't see a 4th for LB, even against the Panthers 19th ranked rush defense.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>JONATHAN STEWART</strong> - Even though he's averaging 13 touches a game, Jonathan Stewart is averaging a pedestrian 3.3 yards per carry. The lowest of his career. He may grab some garbage time touches towards the end of the game, but the Philly defense will be locked on him by then.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Sneaky Picks</h1>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>ED DICKSON</strong> - I know it's hard to consider a guy who went for 175 yards receiving a "sneak pick", but 121 of those yards came on 2 plays. Even so, Dickson's production has gone up every week since Olsen's injury, so I''d consider him a middle to high TE2.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>NELSON AGHOLOR</strong> - Let me start off by saying I'm not huge on Nelson Agholor. But, if you're looking for a bye week replacement, you could do a lot worse than a guy who is currently top 25 in points in ppr leagues.
                                </p>
                                <p>And if you need a running back, <strong>Corey Clement</strong> is probably the best back you're going to find on the waiver wire, so hopefully Adrian Peterson is available in your league.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>In the end</strong>, I think the Panthers win this one handily. Cam looks to be back to his 2015 MVP form and has a plethora of weapons around him. Heck, I didn't even mention Chirstian McCaffrey. If the Eagles pass rush is unable to corral Newton, they could be in for a long night.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                        <p>We are already a quarter of the way through the season which is crazy to think about. Teams have now had time to play through rust and establish their identities on offense, which has opened the door for many revelations.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">
                        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#exampleAccordion" href="#readBlog13" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="readBlog13">Read Blog</a>

                            <p>
                                This is a perfect time for us to look at these revelations and see what lessons were learned in week 4 and what those ramifications mean from a fantasy perspective.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> torched the Titans defense for 4 TD’s through the air and 1 on the ground, making him the number one QB performer in week 4. His legs are more than enough to keep him in the top-15 range weekly, and when he’s throwing it like he was on Sunday he is a dangerous weapon. He gets Cleveland and Indianapolis in 2 of the next 4 weeks too so keep Watson in your lineup and enjoy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With <strong>Chris Carson</strong> now on IR with an ankle injury, many will look to either Eddie Lacy or Thomas Rawls to fill in behind Carson but <strong>J.D. McKissic</strong> is who I would target on the waiver wire. In the 5 touches he was given following Carson’s injury, he amassed over 60 yards and 2 TD’s. Although he looked great, that Seahawks offensive line is still not great and if you stay away from that backfield I don’t think you’re missing out on much.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Cam Newton</strong> recovered in a big way on Sunday at New England, and the biggest beneficiary of his big week 4 performance was <strong>Devin Funchess</strong> (7 catches, 70 yards, 2 TD’s). His usage has increased each week this season and I like him as a weekly flex play moving forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> exploded for 111 yards and TD (as well as an incredible touchdown celebration) on Monday night, showing just how impactful he can be on any given Sunday. He gets a tough matchup next week at Houston and if he struggles there I would start making offers for him as his schedule in weeks 11-17 is extremely juicy (vs. Buf, @NYJ, vs. Oak, vs. LAC, vs. Mia). He could be a catalyst for a championship run for many fantasy owners.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many fantasy owners are likely frustrated with <strong>Martavis Bryant</strong>, as he has eclipsed 50 yards receiving in a game just once with only 1 TD to date. I would buy low on the Clemson star as the home games are coming, and <strong>Ben Roethlisberger</strong> should get better as the season progresses. The talent and opportunity are there, and you can get him pretty cheap right now.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Practice Patience</h1>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Joe Mixon</strong> got 17 carries on Sunday vs. the Browns but only turned that into 29 yards rushing. The Bengals got out to a big lead early though, and the Browns loaded the box as the Bengals ran out the clock. I would be patient with the Oklahoma product as this offense is finally heating up. He is still supremely talented and should be much more comfortable in week 5 with Buffalo coming to town.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am continuing to be patient with <strong>Amari Cooper</strong>. I completely understand the frustration though (less than 10 yards receiving in back-to-back weeks) but trading him now won’t get you anywhere near the value in return compared to the draft pick you invested to get him. Cooper is still the guy that has had over 1,000 yards in each season and positive matchup and regression is something I would hold out for.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Time to Panic</h1>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Isaiah Crowell</strong> has been brutal for fantasy owners as he has not topped 44 yards rushing in a game in the early part of the season. His snaps, touches (only 7 carries in week 4), and targets have consistently gone down as <strong>Duke Johnson Jr.</strong>’s have gone up (4 carries, 10 targets in week 4). Playing on a team that will almost always be in catch-up mode, Crowell is no longer start worthy in my opinion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It has been a rough couple of weeks for <strong>Jay Cutler</strong>. He has pretty much been held scoreless (outside of a garbage-time TD to <strong>Devante Parker</strong> in week 3) in plus matchups against the Jets and Saints and quite honestly has looked terrible. The schedule only gets tougher moving forward and if Cutler is struggling like this, I think you have to tamper expectations for <strong>Jay Ajayi</strong> and all of the pass catchers until some improvements are made. Not a good time in South Beach right now.
                            </p>
                            <h1>My Non-Football Related Tidbit of the Week</h1>
                            <p>
                                This Friday, Blade Runner 2049 hits theatres and while I have no doubts it is going to be incredible, you need to watch the original Blade Runner film that debuted in 1982. Harrison Ford is in his prime and Ridley Scott crafts one of the most beautifully cinematic atmospheres ever captured on the big screen. It addresses so many elements of humanity and what makes us human that you will be thinking about exactly what it all means for days. The movie has an incredible soundtrack that just oozes the 80’s as well. It’s one of the best Sci-Fi films of all time and holds up to this day, and if you have time outside of watching football this weekend give it a watch.

                        <p>We are already through three weeks of fantasy football action, and while there have been many takeaways (some good and some bad) I see this stretch as absolutely vital to fantasy owners’ quest for a trophy.</p>

                                This is the time to buy low on underachieving stars primed for a bounce back as well as sell high on some guys who just won’t produce for the rest of the season like they have early. All of this and more will be highlighted in our Week 4 fantasy preview.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Players I Like</h1>
                            <p>
                                I like both <strong>Jordan Howard</strong> and <strong>Tarik Cohen</strong> to perform against the Packers. The Packers allow 5.75 ypc against rushers to the right of the center, and that just happens to be where Chicago frequents their rushing attack. Howard should put up some solid yardage, and Cohen will be active enough in the passing game to justify a flex start.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: Howard- 20 carries, 85 yds, 3 rec, 30 yds, 0.7 TD’s; Cohen- 10 carries, 50 yards, 6 rec, 60 yds, 0.3 TD’s</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Judging from what <strong>T.Y. Hilton</strong> did to the Browns on Sunday (153 yds, 1 TD), <strong>A.J. Green</strong> is in line for another monster game, and those who bought low and didn’t pack should surely be rewarded with another big day from the Georgia product.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: 8 rec, 105 yds, 0.9 TD’s</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Devante Parker</strong>’s week 3 stat line was inflated due to some garbage time scoring (against the Jets, I never thought I would say that), but with New Orleans on deck, Parker should have some big production coming throughout all 4 quarters on Sunday morning. Make sure you have him in your lineup.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: 5 rec, 90 yds, 0.7 TD’s</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Dak Prescott</strong> bounced back from a rough game at Denver with 23 fantasy points in another tough matchup at Arizona. This week, he welcomes the Los Angeles Rams to town. This is the same Rams team that just surrendered 39 points to <strong>Brian Hoyer</strong> last Thursday. I think they try to key in on Zeke, and I have Dak as a top-5 QB play this week.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: 23-30, 290 yds, 2.5 TD’s; 30 rush yds</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Deshaun Watson looked <strong>Ryan Griffins</strong> way early and often on Sunday against the Patriots to the tune of 61 yards and TD on 6 catches. The Texans host the Titans who just surrendered 75 yards to <strong>Jimmy Graham</strong>. Griffin has a chance to produce similar results and I would not be shocked to see him get in the end zone.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: 5 rec, 60 yds, 0.4 TD’s</i>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Amari Cooper</strong> has struggled mightily the past couple of weeks, and things do not look better this week with a trip to Denver. Number 1 receivers notoriously struggle in the Mile High city, and Cooper’s struggle will likely continue on Sunday.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: 6 rec, 50 yds, 0.2 TD’s</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Frank Gore</strong>’s fantasy numbers the past 2 weeks don’t look too bad, at 10.6 and 12.7 for weeks 2 and 3, but looking beyond that you will see a runner who is running at a sub 3.0 ypc clip and is really only useful if he is getting in the end zone. The Colts travel to Seattle on Sunday night, and I don’t foresee a favorable game script like last week against Cleveland. Yes, <strong>DeMarco Murray</strong> had a big game against Seattle, but that was all based on a fluky 70-yard TD run, and Gore hasn’t had a rush longer than 50 yards since 2014. Stay away from Gore if you can for week 4.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: 15 rush, 45 yds, 2 rec, 10 yds, 0.2 TD’s</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Speaking of <strong>DeMarco Murray</strong>, he faces a stout Texans defensive front on Sunday, and while he bounced back nicely against Seattle in week 3 I would tamper expectations for week 4. The Texans only surrendered 11.6 TOTAL fantasy points to Patriots running back in week 3, and with Derrick Henry clearly in the mix in Tennessee I don’t foresee big production from Murray.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: 17 rush, 50 yds, 3 rec, 20 yds, 0.4 TD’s</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Per Pro Football Reference, <strong>Ben Roethlisberger</strong> has thrown more INTs than TDs in his last 3 games against the Ravens (5 INTs to 4 TDs). Couple that with a sluggish start to the passing game for the Steelers, I think you’re perfectly okay benching Big Ben for the likes of <strong>Tyrod Taylor, Carson Palmer, or Trevor Siemian</strong> who all have plus matchups in week 4.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: 24-35, 210 yds, 1.1 TD’s</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Zach Ertz</strong> has been on a tear to start the 2017 NFL season, providing weekly top-5 TE value to owners who invested a pick in him. In week 4 he gets the Los Angeles Chargers defense who have only allowed 4.2 fantasy PPG to tight ends and just held <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> to a whopping 1 yard receiving. Ertz is supremely talented and could still produce, but unless he gets into the end zone, he is at best a low-end TE1 for week 4.
                                <br>
                                <i>Stat Projection: 5 rec, 40 yds, 0.3 TD’s</i>

                                Deep Sleeper Desperation Play of the Week
                            </h1>
                            <p>
                                Fresh off of a 95 yard &amp; 1 TD performance, <strong>Robby Anderson</strong> (Jets) is an intriguing week 4 flex play for those dealing with injuries or needing a big week in your flex spot. He gets the Jaguars in week 4, and the strength of that defensive unit lies in Calais Campbell and that front seven. Jalen Ramsey will likely be shadowing <strong>Jermaine Kearse</strong>, which should leave a good matchup for Anderson to hit a big play or two. He won’t get you a ton of receptions but the big play ability is there, so if you’re in need of an upside play at the flex Robby Anderson is who I like.

                            <h4><strong>QB</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Matt Ryan</strong> - Slow start but weapons are plentiful with a favorable schedule ahead! Next 4: BUF, MIA, @NWE, @NYJ</p>
                            <h4><strong>RB</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>CJ Anderson</strong> - Let the Charles hype push CJ under the radar. Avg 4.4 YPC and is the much better blocker of the two. Next 4: OAK, NYG, @LAC, @KAN
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jay Ajayi</strong> - Bad game against the Jets, still the workhorse. Next 4: NO, TEN, @ATL, NYJ
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Joe Mixon</strong> - More involved with New OC Bill Lazor - RB3/FLEX moving forward possibly even RB2. Next 4: @CLE, BUF, @PIT, IND
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>WR</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Marqise Lee</strong> - Averaging 9.5 targets per game without ARob. Nice schedule ahead. Next 4: @NYJ, @PIT, LAR, @IND
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Amari Cooper</strong> - Dropping balls and playing awful last two weeks. He can be baught low and is still an elite WR. Schedule ahead is great after this week. Next 4: @DEN, BAL, LAC, KAN
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>TE</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> - Top 2 player at the position and only had 1 target week 3. Schedule shows tough games ahead and that is when Kelce shines. Next 4: WAS, @HOU, PIT, @OAK
                            </p>
                            <h1>Trade Away</h1>
                            <h4><strong>RB</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jordan Howard</strong> - Here is your chance to release yourself from Jeremy Hill 2.0! TD and Volume dependent with a tough schedule ahead. Lost passing work and snaps to Cohen. Coming off a huge game so it shouldn’t be hard to move him. Next 4: @GNB, MIN, @BAL, CAR
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Chris Thompson</strong> - This guy has struck lightening in a Bottle. He has 4 TD’s on just 27 total touches. Averaging a TD on every 6.75 touches. That is unsustainable. His frame is on the smaller end so touches likely wont go up, and now that defenses are aware of how good he has been...He will be a focal point for DC’s. Trade high now! Next 4: @KAN, SFO, @PHI, DAL
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>WR</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> - Coming off a huge game against the 49ers. Goff has a perfect QBR when targeting Watkins this year but that is about to change with matchups against corners like; Richard Sherman, Jalen Ramsey, Patrick Peterson, and Janoris Jenkins all within the next few weeks! Next 4: @DAL, SEA, @JAC, ARI

                        <h3>Week 3 Winners &amp; Losers</h3>
                        <p>Sept 26th, 2017 Marcel Hull</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Week 3 of the NFL Season was by far the most exciting yet. We saw close high-scoring affairs in almost all of the games on Sunday, and there were many winners that emerged from those contests.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">
                        <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#exampleAccordion" href="#readBlog10" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="readBlog10">Read Blog</a>

                            <p>
                                There were also those who continued to disappoint on Sunday, raising some red flags and panic across the fantasy world. We will highlight some of these winners and losers and help you decide what to do with these guys going forward.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Winners</h1>
                            <h4><strong>Russell Wilson</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                After two pretty terrible starts, panic had begun setting in on Russell Wilson. Playing behind possibly the league’s worst offensive line, many speculated Wilson was in line for a down year. He exploded for 373 yards and 4 touchdowns through the air and pitched in 26 receiving yards as well. The Seahawks seemed to gain a little bit of momentum in the second half against the Titans and I love the matchup next week against the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
                            <h4><strong>Joe Mixon</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                The Bengals seemed to have finally handed the reigns over to Mixon after inexplicably seeing 10 touches or less in both of his 2017 games prior to Sunday. In a tough matchup at Green Bay, Mixon clearly exhibited his skills in both the running and passing game. You may still be able to buy low on him, and if you can then I would go get him. I think some big production is coming for the Oklahoma product.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Stefon Diggs</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                I will admit, I was not confident on Diggs in week 3. He only had 27 yards last week in Sam Bradford’s absence, and with Bradford missing time again I was not sure how Diggs would fare. Diggs rewarded those who started him with 173 yards and 2 touchdowns on 8 catches and is displaying the elite talent that had others including myself so high on him coming into the season. You can safely put Diggs in your lineup each week at this point, both in standard and PPR leagues.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>T.Y. Hilton</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                Hilton had a pretty quiet start to the 2017 season, but exploded for 153 yards and a touchdown, displaying the speed and elite acceleration we’ve grown accustomed to seeing. If he can continue to build a steady rapport with Jacoby Brissett moving forward, I foresee more explosive games coming Hilton’s way. Next week will be tough at Seattle, but after that the schedule opens up a bit for the Colts, and I would be looking to buy low on him if he struggles next week.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Marcedes Lewis</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                A name none of us expected to be on this list, Lewis might want to permanently stay in London after Sunday. Lewis had not scored a touchdown since week 2 of last season, and on Sunday he found paydirt 3 times. I am not too excited about Lewis though, as age and an inconsistent quarterback have never been a recipe for steady success for tight ends. He is definitely worth a look next week though, as the Jags are on the road at the Jets in week 4.

                            <h1>Losers</h1>
                            <h4><strong>Cam Newton</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                It is now time to panic in Carolina. Facing a Saints defense that had given up at least 3 touchdowns through the air in both of its previous 2 games, many thought Newton would be a surefire QB1 for this week at least. Throwing for 167 yards, 0 TD’s and 3 INT’s is a horrendous stat line for a quarterback who is seeming to regress with his mechanics and accuracy. Dropping him is definitely an option at this point, and it will take a lot for Newton to get into the good graces of fantasy owners again.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>C.J. Anderson</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                After exploding for 150 yards and 2 TD’s in week 2, many thought Anderson was finally back to being a weekly stud. I was skeptical as we have seen huge games from Anderson before only to be followed by minimal scoring. In week 3, Anderson gained only 36 yards (8 carries) on the ground, and was out-carried by Jamaal Charles (9 rushed, 57 yards and a TD). At this point, I am not sure what to recommend doing with Anderson. Is he an RB2? A flex? A stud? Is he even Bronco? This is giving me a headache, let’s move on.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Terrelle Pryor Sr.</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                After Sunday, Pryor Sr. (19 yards on 2 catches) now has not topped 70 receiving yards, has not sniffed the end zone, and has seen his targets drop from 11 in week 1 to just 4 in week 2. He seems to have almost no chemistry with Kirk Cousins, and until that happens I see Pryor as a matchup-dependent WR3 at the moment. Not what fantasy owners want to hear, especially for those who invested at round 3 pick on him.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Amari Cooper </strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                Amari Cooper finished week 3 with a whopping 6 yards on 1 reception against the Redskins on Sunday night. That must mean Crabtree had an awesome game and continued his dominance in that Raider receiving corps right? Well, except for the fact that he finished with 1 catch for 7 yards himself. This was just a horrendous game for the Raiders offense as a whole, and I can guarantee that there are many owners who are becoming quite impatient with Cooper. Now is the prime opportunity to buy low for him, and I would be aggressive in going to get him. Much better days are ahead for Cooper.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Hunter Henry</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                For the second time in 3 weeks, Hunter Henry was nowhere to be seen in the box score or on the field for the Chargers. He showed what he can do in week 2 with 80 yards on 7 catches, but with that being sandwiched in between games with no catches and no playing time it is impossible to trust him in your lineup. The talent is there, but the opportunity just won’t be there until Gates is out of the picture.

                            <h4><strong>Quarter Backs</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Trevor Siemian - DEN: 1-3% FAAB Budget:</strong> Siemian has looked like a completely different player this year. Offensive line play has improved and the Running Game has vastly improved with the resurgence of CJ Anderson and Jamaal Charles. Thru 2 games, Siemian has thrown 6 passing TD’s and has even rushed for 1 TD. He is averaging over 220 yards per game. His next three are hardly scary, @ Buffalo - Home vs. Oak, and Home vs. NYG. Buffalo has looked good thru 2 Games but has only played one Viable QB in Cam Newton who was injured and lost Greg Olsen during the game. Oakland gave up 2 passing TD’s to the Jets week 2 and the Giants have given up 6 total passing TD’s thru 2 weeks.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Deshaun Watson - HOU: 1-2% FAAB Budget:</strong> Watson came in at Halftime week 1 and ended the game with 8 FP scoring 1 PATD. Week 2 Watson Started and while he didn't impress thru the air, he ended with 18.95 FP mostly due in part to his 67 yard TD run right before half time. Watson has developed Chemistry with Hopkins and his ability to keep the play alive / run when needed.. makes him intriguing for QB Streamers. His next 2 games are workable. @ NWE then home against the Titans. Houston will likely be down against the Patriots and could use his legs more often than not to try and Keep up with Brady and Company.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Running Backs</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                Chris Carson, D’onta Foreman, and Alvin Kamara should already be owned. If not, they are all worth 10-15% or more of your FAAB Budget.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Same Perine - WAS: 8-11% FAAB Budget:</strong> Perine should already be owned in most deep leagues but if he's not, he's a priority this week. Rob Kelley injured his ribs in week 2 and will likely miss week 3. This is Perine’s chance to take over. Once Kelley went down week 2, Perine carried the load finished with 67 yards on 21 carries. It is worth noting that 3rd down specialist Chris Thompson only logged 3 carries while vastly outproducing serine due in part to large runs for TD’s. Perine will carry the load week 3 against Oakland who can be run on after giving up 95 yards in week 1 on the ground and 126 against the Jets in week 2.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Chris Johnson - ARI: 5-7% FAAB Budget:</strong> David Johnson is gone until week 12 at a minimum. Chris Johnson was brought in after week 1 and played 26% of the snaps after the Cardinals named Kerwyn Williams their starter, who played 27%. Bruce Arians has admitted that Chris Johnson will move up the depth chart going forward. He finished week 1 with 44 rushing yards on 11 carries. He may be their best bet going forward on early downs while <strong>Andre Ellington</strong> will capture most if not all of 3rd down work. Andre Ellington is also worth a look as he finished with 5 receiving targets and 3 receptions week 2. Ellington plays 45% of the snaps in a close game but couldn't do much with his opportunities.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Wide Receivers</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                Tyler Lockett, Marqise Lee, Allen Hurns, Kendall Wright, and Devin Funchess should already be owned in deeper leagues. If they are not, you could expect to pay 9-12% or more of your FAAB budget for all of the names mentioned.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>J.J. Nelson - ARI: 9-12% FAAB Budget:</strong> With the news of John Brown already being ruled out of week 3, JJ is a must have. Before entering week 2, Nelson has averaged 13+ FPPG when John Brown is not in the lineup. He finished week 2 with 22 FP in a PPR format. He had 7 targets, 5 receptions, 120 yards, and a TD. He will likely take over the number 2 role even if John Brown comes back after posting two great performances back to back. There is talk that John Brown could miss an extended amount of time. If that is the case, I am comfortable saying that Nelson will be a solid WR3 and or Flex moving forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Rashard Higgins - CLE: 8-11% FAAB Budget:</strong> With Corey Coleman going down in week 2 for 6-8 weeks, Higgins will likely be the Browns new WR1. Britt has disappointed and as a result, the Practice squad player who was just recently called up... Higgins, will be a factor. Higgins finished with 11 targets, 7 receptions, and 95 yards! He draws a great matchup in week 3 against the Colts who were just torched by JJ Nelson in week 2.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jermaine Kearse - NYJ: 5-7% FAAB Budget:</strong> Kearse has done nothing but impress with his short time in New York. He now has 11 receptions, 123 yards and 2 TD’s thru 2 weeks of action. He has taken over as the WR1 and will continue to be targeting going forward as he develops trust with McCown. He will draw two tougher matchups in weeks 3 and 4 against the Dolphins and Jaguars, but he is the Jets best option at WR and they will likely be down in both games.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Tight Ends</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Zach Miller - CHI: 2-4% FAAB Budget:</strong> Miller has been a targeted consistently after the Bears have lost both Cameron Meredith and Kevin White for the season. He has received 15 targets turning those into 10 catches thru 2 weeks of play. Expect Miller to continue to receive a large amount of the target share moving forward due mostly in part to not having anyone else. He is the security blanket and a redbone threat ( if the Bears ever get in the Redzone ).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Austin Sefarian-Jenkins - NYJ: 1-3% FAAB Budget:</strong> After serving a 2 game suspension, ASJ is back for week 3. He is a total wild card in a bad offense. That being said, he could help you win your league... reports in training camp pegged him as the best player on the field and un-guard-able. He’ll draw the 3rd easiest schedule for TE’s in the next 4 weeks.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Week 2 Takeaways</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>In what was a rather low-scoring week 1 for fantasy owners, many were eager to get to week 2 to see players either bounce back from disappointing week 1 performances or build upon strong debuts and entrench themselves as fantasy forces for their teams.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">

                            <h4><strong>Texans vs. Bengals</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>DeAndre Hopkins</strong> was predictably peppered with targets, and while he was rather inefficient (7 catches for 73 yards on 13 targets) I am confident in him going forward. As <strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> becomes more confident and his rapport builds with Hopkins, there should be some big production coming for the Clemson product.</p>
                            <p>
                                Right now is a prime time to buy low on <strong>A.J. Green</strong>. If you can find an owner that is panicking after another mediocre outing, go get him as quickly as you can. Even at his “worst” he is getting you 60-70 yards each game, and the Bengals eventually have to score a touchdown right? When they do, he will be the biggest beneficiary and I am not worried one bit about Green.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the opposite end of the spectrum, I would be looking to sell <strong>Lamar Miller</strong>. He was once again pedestrian on the ground, and didn’t sniff a touchdown. With <strong>D’Onta Foreman</strong> getting more carries and being more active in the offense, I don’t think Miller will come anywhere close to providing the 2nd to 3rd round value that you had to take him at.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Dolphins vs. Chargers</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jay Ajayi</strong> was every bit the workhorse back that we predicted him to be, and was very impressive in his first regular season game. Rushing for over 120 yards on 28 carries, Ajayi could be this year's DeMarco Murray. He is one of the safest bets in an era where there aren’t many of them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a fan here, congrats to Antonio Gates for breaking the Tight End touchdown record. He has had a remarkable career and has always played with respect and toughness that I will always appreciate. His protege <strong>Hunter Henry</strong> caught 7 balls for 80 yards and bounced back nicely from a tough week 1. I am excited to see what he does in week 3.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was a bit worried about <strong>Jarvis Landry</strong> this year. He had a new quarterback in Jay Cutler and an emerging <strong>DeVante Parker</strong>, but he saw 15 targets, catching 13 of them for 80 yards. He should once again be a PPR machine, but I like Parker for the touchdown upside in Standard going forward.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Jets vs. Raiders</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                As long as Josh McCown is playing behind center, <strong>Jermaine Kearse</strong> is an interesting weekly flex play. WIth 3 TD’s in two games now, Kearse is the preferred option in an offense that will be throwing a lot as it will be playing catch up all year. You could do much worse at the flex position right now.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Michael Crabtree</strong> is proving once again to be an elite WR2 in this league and those who doubted him again this offseason (I am guilty of this) were just flat out wrong. 6, catches 80 yards and 3 TD’s are lines we expected from Amari Cooper, and Crabtree now looks like the preferred target in that Raiders offense.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is your weekly stay away from the Jets running back segment. They are splitting carries evenly, and with little touchdown upside, I see no benefit in having either <strong>Matt Forte</strong> or <strong>Bilal Powell</strong> in your lineup.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>49ers vs. Seahawks</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                I’m continuing to be patient with <strong>Russell Wilson</strong>, but if he struggles again at Tennessee in week 3, I will be concerned with him moving forward. That offensive line is horrendous, and they are going to have to figure some things out if they are to get back to their explosive ways.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Carlos Hyde</strong> had a tremendous game, rushing for over 120 yards and being actively involved in the passing game. If <strong>Bryan Hoyer</strong> can get anything going in the passing game and opens those running lanes up even more for Hyde, he could be in line for a huge season.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                WIth Eddie Lacy being a surprise scratch and Thomas Rawls available, many thought he would be the guy. But it now appears that <strong>Chris Carson</strong> is that guy, and has looked powerful while doing it. Running behind that line leaves a lot to be desired, but as a waiver wire pickup Carson could prove valuable to fantasy teams from this point on.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Browns vs.Ravens</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Javorious “Buck” Allen</strong> out-touched <strong>Terrance West</strong> in both the rushing and passing game, and is clearly the most effective back in this offense. A dynamic dual-threat running back with a quarterback who loves to check down, Allen could be on his way to a RB2 level season.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If DeShone Kizer continues to miss playing time, then Kevin Hogan should continue to target <strong>Duke Johnson Jr.</strong> and his usage should justify a weekly flex option moving forward if that’s the case.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Bills vs. Panthers</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                With <strong>Greg Olsen</strong> likely to miss a significant time with a broken foot, <strong>Cam Newton</strong> is best used as a matchup dependent QB2. With his rushing total a fraction of what it once was (only 27 yards in week 2), he won’t provide enough value through the air to be your QB1.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> finished with 10 yards on 8 carries, but should provide enough value in the passing game (34 yards on 4 catches) to be a weekly RB2 and a flex play in standard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I still like <strong>Tyrod Taylor</strong> as a sleeper QB despite the rough start. He will produce enough rushing (8 carries, 55) to make up for his passing deficiencies, and should still be fine in matchups with plus defenses.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Cardinals vs. Colts</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Carson Palmer’s</strong> stats ended up looking pretty good, but he had to play catch up to get the Cards into overtime vs. the colts (who were torched by <strong>Jared Goff</strong> by the way). He did not look great, and if it takes him overtime to amass 15+ fantasy points against the Colts then it’s not looking too good for him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jack Doyle</strong> seems to be Jacoby Brissett’s favorite weapon in this Colts offense (8 catches for 79 yards), and as long as Brissett is in at QB, Doyle should be a weekly starter going forward.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Titans vs. Jaguars</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>DeMarco Murray</strong> only got 9 carries on Sunday, and after the game it was revealed he was dealing with a hamstring injury. This opened the door for <strong>Derrick Henry</strong> (14 carries, 92 yards and a TD) and he was very impressive. At the very least he will continue to eat into Murray’s carries and could be entering into weekly flex consideration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                14 carries for 40 yards might be a line we see a few more time for <strong>Leonard Fournette</strong>. Blake Bortles was horrendous in this game (what’s new?) and defenses will continue to key in on Fournette. He is talented enough and active enough in the passing game to be just fine, but he will have some games like this. Just hope he keeps getting into the end zone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Marcus Mariota</strong> was again not great (215 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT), and has a tough week 3 matchup with the Seahawks coming to town. Once this rough stretch is over though, I like Mariota and think some positive regression is on the way.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Eagles vs. Chiefs </strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Kareem Hunt</strong> continues to dazzle in his rookie campaign, amassing 81 yards and 2 TD’s on the ground and an additional 28 yards through the air. He is a weekly RB1 and could be on his way to winning some 2017 fantasy leagues.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Eagles have a non-existent running game through the first couple of weeks, which means <strong>Carson Wentz</strong> will be throwing a ton, and I like him as a weekly top 10 QB moving forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Speaking of that horrible Eagles running attack (107 total yards in week 2), <strong>LeGarette Blount</strong> is probably droppable at this point, and outside of Sproles in a PPR league, no one in that backfield is worth owning, let alone starting.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Patriots vs. Saints</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Tom Brady</strong> bounced back in a large way on Sunday, throwing for 450 yards and 3 TD’s. Granted, it was against a Saints defense that was lit up by Sam Bradford last week, but it was encouraging to see the Pats get back on track.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Adrian Peterson</strong> is borderline droppable at this point as he hasn’t amassed over 40 yards in either of 2 games so far. Father time might have finally caught up with AP.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While everyone else was catching touchdowns and amassing yardage from Tom Brady, <strong>Brandin Cooks</strong> finished with 2 catches for 37 yards. I think he is an interesting buy low target, and would see if I can get him on the cheap. The explosive games are coming.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Vikings vs. Steelers</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                If Sam Bradford continues to miss games, <strong>Stefon Diggs</strong> (27 yards) and <strong>Adam Thielen</strong> (44 yards) are probably best suited as flex plays. Let’s hope Bradford is able to suit up in week 3.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Martavis Bryant</strong> shook off some week 1 rust to the tune of 91 yards and a touchdown. As this offense heats up, look for some more big games coming from Bryant.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Bears vs. Buccaneers</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jordan Howard</strong> only say 9 carries for 7 yards, but has been dealing with an injured shoulder (was seen in an arm sling after the game). If he forced to miss any time, <strong>Tarik Cohen</strong> (8 catches in week 2) enters RB2 category as an elite pass catching running back with enough between the tackles burst to be productive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jacquizz Rodgers</strong> was not very efficient with his 19 carries, but 67 yards and a touchdown are perfect for a weekly flex play. The volume should justify a weekly start at least until Doug Martin comes back from suspension.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Mike Evans</strong> (97 yards and a TD) has officially entered the Elite WR1 tier, and *Hot Take Alert* might be even more valuable that Julio Jones and Odell Beckham going forward.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Cowboys vs. Broncos</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>C.J. Anderson</strong> (150+ yards and 2 TD’s) looked excellent on Sunday, running with burst and being a force in the passing game. If he can stay healthy and the offensive line continues to block well, I like him as a high end RB2 moving forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Dez Bryant</strong> saw 16 targets, yet caught only 7 of those for 59 yards. He did score a touchdown though, and I think this was just a tough matchup for the Cowboys offense all together. Better days are ahead for the stud receiver.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Trevor Siemian</strong> looked great on Sunday, finishing with 230 yards, 4 TD’s, and a 116.0 passer rating. I think this was more a statement on the Cowboys lackluster defense than Siemian’s ability. He is not throwing the ball deep at all, and I still don’t project much value outside of 2 QB leagues moving forward.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Redskins vs. Rams</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Todd Gurley</strong> ran with the power and patience that saw him as a top-5 pick last year. Averaging 5.5 YPC and a touchdown along with 48 yards and a touchdown through the air, Gurley looks to be finding his elite form once again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>“Fat” Rob Kelley</strong> looked great Sunday (12 carries for 78 yards) until he went down with an injury. <strong>Semaje Perine</strong> came in and got 21 carries, but only turned that into 67 yards. If Kelley misses time, I think Perine does offer some interest value as a volume flex play in week 3.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> only received 2 targets on Sunday. He caught both for 30 yards, but if he doesn't get more looks his way, I can’t justify having him in your lineup every week.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Packers vs. Falcons</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Ty Montgomery</strong> was once again effecting in week 2, amassing 110 yards and 2 total touchdowns. He is out there on all 3 downs, and regardless of matchup will be a top-12 RB for me moving forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Tevin Coleman</strong> ran well, but once again was dependent on a goal-line touchdown to be a startable option. The touchdowns won’t always be there and when they aren’t you won’t be happy having him in your lineup.
                            </p>
                            <h4><strong>Lions vs. Giants</strong></h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Evan Engram</strong> was the lone bright spot on a tough night for the Giants offense. He saw 7 targets, catching 4 of them for 49 yards and a touchdown. With the tight end landscape being the way that it is, he is probably a startable weekly option.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Ameer Abdullah</strong> ran well (86 yards, 5.1 YPC) against a stout Giants defensive line. He will still give up carries and third-down work to <strong>Theo Riddick</strong>, but this was an encouraging sign for Abdullah.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Those that thought <strong>Kenny Golladay</strong> would continue his hot week 1 start saw him crash hard back to earth with 1 catch for 8 yards. He still has plenty of talent and good games will be there, but it will be impossible to predict when.

                                it is probably a good thing. I am only picking players that have high ceilings and good matchups for STARTS, players who have high floors and bad matchups for SITS, and players who I think can get 10 points or more for FLEX!</p>

                        <p>Both the Houston Texans and Cincinnati Bengals had high expectations coming into the 2017 NFL season. Houston was coming off of a trip to the Divisional round in the playoffs and Cincinnati was getting a healthy Andy Dalton and A.J. Green back. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">

                            <p><strong>Houston Texans vs. Cincinnati Bengals</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Both had horrendous week 1 losses as they combined for 7 points total between their respective games. It is now time to look forward, as both teams look to get back on track offensively Thursday night on NFL Network. We will look at players to be high on, not so high on, and a potential sleeper who could jump start your team for this week 2 in fantasy.</p>
                            <p>
                            </p><strong>Good Matchups</strong>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Andy Dalton</strong> This might be the one call that comes back to haunt me after week 2. I think Andy Dalton gets back on track Thursday night. The Houston Texans secondary did well last week, but it was against Blake Bortles (with no Allen Robinson by the way). Facing a much more potent offense with some legit weapons in Green, Eifert, and the running game, I think Dalton projects to have a solid game at home in week 2. Stat Projection: 25-35, 280 yards, 1.9 TD’s
                                <br>
                                <strong>Lamar Miller</strong> The Bengals were gashed by the Ravens in the ground game last Sunday (150+ yards rushing) and I think that trend continues for week 2. With Deshaun Watson now entrenched as the starter, this should create some new running lanes for Miller. If he is not able to produce this week though, then you should probably look to trade him away. I am confident in him for this matchup though, and would not be afraid of starting him Thursday night. Stat Projection: 23 rush, 90 yards; 5 catches, 30 yards, 0.7 TD’s.
                                <br>
                                <strong>Bengals D/ST</strong> I like Deshaun Watson a lot. But his first NFL start will come on primetime Thursday night against a solid Bengals secondary and a subpar offensive line. I think he will struggle moving the ball consistently as he gets his feet wet in the league, and could see some sacks and turnovers coming for the Bengals D. Feel confident rolling them out there week 2. Stat Projection: 18.5 points allowed, 280 total yards, 1.5 TD’s, 0.9 turnovers
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Not So Good Matchups</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Joe Mixon</strong> While Mixon is still the most talented back in that Bengals backfield, he only got 11 touches against the Ravens on Sunday which severely limits his potential impact. Marvin Lewis has always been conservative, especially in big games, and I think that trend continues week 2 unfortunately. Facing a stout Texans front will not help Mixon by any means, and until the guard is officially passed to Mixon only start him if you absolutely have to (sorry David Johnson owners). Stat Projection: 10 carries, 35 yards; 2 catches, 15 yards, 0.3 TD’s
                                <br>
                                <strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> Another highly touted rookie on this list, Watson gets his first NFL start on Thursday night. This is a tough matchup for Watson as Cincinnati ranked 11th in 2016 against the pass. Expect a conservative game plan from HC Bill O’Brien as they try to alleviate some of the pressure off of Watson. Don’t expect too much from the rookie on Thursday. Stat Projection: 18-25, 200 yards; 5 carries, 25 yards; 1.1 TD’s
                                <br>
                                <strong>A.J. Green</strong> While I like Andy Dalton to bounce back, I think Green will see double coverage most of the night, leaving the others (John Ross, Tyler Boyd, Tyler Eifert, Brandon Lafell) with the opportunity to produce. Houston was 2nd in the league against number 1 Wide Receivers in 2016 (via NFL.com), and that trend should continue here in week 2 with much of the same personnel along that Texan front 7 and secondary. Of course your starting Green because he is a stud, but temper your expectations for the superstar in week 2. Stat projection: 6 catches, 65 yards, 0.4 TD’s

                            <p><strong>Sleeper Pick of the Week</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Giovani Bernard</strong> Truthfully, I don’t feel great about this call. I don’t see too many points being scored in this one with two excellent defenses and two struggling offenses. But If you dealing with an injury or needing a big play potential guy in your lineup, I think Bernard could provide a big play or two on Thursday night. Bernard looked the best of all the backs in that crowded Bengals backfield on Sunday, and I think Dalton looks his way often in the passing game as the Texans should be aggressive in their blitz packages. He won’t have the volume that you want, but if a big play is what you’re needing then Bernard is probably your best bet here.
                                <br>Stat projection: 10 rushes, 45 yards; 6 catches, 50 yards, 0.5 TD’s</p>

                            Man oh man, how awesome it is to have football back in our lives officially. Finally, after months of preparation, we got football back in a large way over the weekend. There were many stars who showed up and even more who disappointed in week 1.
                        </p>

                                There were also some players who emerged as potential stars and others who faltered in their 2017 debut. We will take a look at each game with some of provide some insight on what to do with these guys in the coming weeks.</p>
                            <p>
                            </p><strong>Chiefs (42) vs. Patriots (27)</strong>
                            <p>
                                Kareem Hunt fumbled on his first NFL snap. He proceeded to follow that up with 250 yards and 3 TD’s. He looked every bit the part of an elite three-down back on Thursday night. I don’t think he has anywhere close to a game like this again, so if someone is willing to offer you a top-5 player for him then I would take that. Other than that, enjoy the ride.
                                <br> Mike Gillislee’s fantasy stats look great. 15 carries and 3 touchdowns seem great but I am selling Gillislee moving forward. Tom Brady did not throw a touchdown and with a healthy Gronk I don’t see much value in Gillislee weekly, especially if he’s not scoring touchdowns.
                                <br> You could tell Tom Brady missed Julian Edelman out there on Thursday night. He did not seem to have the same rhythm that were accustomed to seeing, and until he builds a stronger rapport with Brandin Cooks I think Brady’s ceiling is a bit capped.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jets (12) vs. Bills (21)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                This probably goes without saying, but it is going to a rough season for the Jets. I don’t want any part of that offense, especially if Forte and Powell are splitting carries. There is not enough points going around in that offense to justify either one of them.
                                <br> LeSean McCoy did what we expected him to, and still was incredibly impressive. Amassing 110 yards on the ground and 49 through the air, he one of the safest bets to put in your lineup going forward.
                                <br> Tyrod Taylor does not get the credit he deserves. The Bills clearly don’t view him as the franchise guy moving forward, but he is a solid fantasy QB especially in 2-QB leagues. You could do a lot worse out there at QB (yes, I’m looking at you Scott Tolzein).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Seahawks (9) vs. Packers (17)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                Not the start we all expected from Russell Wilson. I am not panicking though. He still has an elite tight end in Graham and possibly the best slot receiver in Baldwin, and has notoriously had slow starts. The big games will be there, so be patient with Wilson.
                                <br> Eddie Lacy is BAD. SO, SO, BAD. Drop him, forget him, he never existed. Eddie who? I like Chris Carson but I think It’s Rawls or bust in the Seattle backfield running behind one of the worst offensive lines in the league.
                                <br> Ty Montgomery was very impressive on Sunday. He ran with patience, power, and more importantly was out there on all 3 downs. He could have a huge year and I am excited to watch him going forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Falcons (23) vs. Bears (17)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                Tarik Cohen displayed all of the abilities that saw him emerge as a viable backup to Jordan Howard. He scored a touchdown and was explosive in both the passing and running game. He’s not a between the tackles kind of back, but in a PPR he is an interesting sleeper to pick up.
                                <br> If Tevin Coleman does not score touchdowns like he did on Sunday, then I don’t see much value in him except as a handcuff to Devonta Freeman. He probably won’t be justifying his draft position anytime soon.
                                <br> If you haven’t seen Austin Hooper’s 88-yard touchdown grab, please go watch it now. After you have seen that awesomeness, Hooper presents an interesting value as a sleeper tight end. The volume will likely not be there, but he could develop into a consistent big play and red zone weapon for Matt Ryan going forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Ravens (20) vs. Bengals (0)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                Well Andy Dalton, that was rough. 5 turnovers and 0 points scored is horrendous, but I think Dalton will be fine. He has always struggled against the Ravens, and his track record shows that much better days are ahead.
                                <br> Joe Mixon was almost nonexistent in this one, and I am a bit worried about him moving forward. I don’t see Jeremy Hill going anywhere (unfortunately) and Gio Bernard will always have a role as long as he is healthy. Mixon is undoubtedly their most talented back, but if the usage is not there, you will be disappointed.
                                <br> Danny Woodhead was looking awesome, but as he usually does, went down and out with a hamstring injury. Buck Allen stepped in with 21 carries, but I like him as a sleeper moving forward. Terrance West is not a pass catcher, and Flacco loves checking it down, so Allen could provide some great value, especially in PPR.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Steelers (21) vs. Browns (18)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                If there is a Le’Veon Bell owner in your league that is discouraged by his 47 total yard week 1 performance, try to go get him. This was a weird game that saw bell only get 10 carries. I am not worried one bit about Bell.
                                <br> I was high on Corey Coleman’s talent coming out of Baylor, but with injuries and other players emerging, Coleman has gone under the radar the past couple of years. He seems to have a strong rapport with Kizer, and I like him as a solid flex play week in and week out going forward.
                                <br> Duke Johnson Jr. had 2 catches for 20 yards and not much else. Crowell overwhelmingly saw the majority of carries, but did not do much with those. I think Johnson will be fine, and would look to buy low on him if he continues his slow start.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Cardinals (23) vs. Lions (35)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                With David Johnson going on IR with a dislocated wrist, I am staying away from the Cardinals offense. Palmer has been bad for about 2 years now, and with no David Johnson I expect defenses to key all in on Larry Fitzgerald. Not good times in Arizona right now.
                                <br> Kenny Golladay was a deep sleeper amongst many experts, and rewarded those with a 4 catch, 69 yard, 2 TD day. I love Golladay’s talent, but could see some becoming too high on him. Heck of a debut though.
                                <br> Ameer Abdullah turned 15 carries into 30 yards, good for a whopping 2.0 ypc. Not. Good. With Theo Riddick improving in health and Dwayne Washington getting goal line work, I don’t see great returns for Abdullah moving forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Jaguars (29) vs. Texans (7)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                There was much concern about Leonard Fournette missing 3 preseason games with a foot injury, but Fournette quickly put those concerns to bed with a 100- yard rushing performance. He ran tough, shifty, and was also active in the passing game, and should have an excellent rookie season ahead. Facing the Colts and Titans twice a year helps too.
                                <br> Man, you’ve got to feel for DeAndre Hopkins. He’s gone through about 5 QB changes in 2 years, and outside of Brian Hoyer none of them seemed to realize they have a top-5 WR talent lining up on the outside. With Deshaun Watson the presumable starter moving forward (10 targets including 3 red zone ones from Watson in the second half), I like Hopkins potential moving forward. Rookie QB’s tend to rely on their star receivers, a la Cam Newton and Steve Smith his rookie year. You never know with the Texans though, so we shall see.
                                <br> The Jaguars defense used to be a push over, but with new addition Calais Campbell (3 sacks in the first half alone) helping to man that front 4, they are no joke. This is a tough, deep defensive unit that should be factored into when making your lineup decisions in the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Raiders (26) vs. Titans (16)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                Corey Davis is the biggest takeaway for me from this game. He was on the field early and often, and was a favorite target for Marcus Mariota, finishing with a respectable 6 catch, 69 yard performance. He will have his down weeks forsure, but I like the rookie as a solid flex play most weeks going forward.
                                <br> How awesome is it to have Beast Mode back? He looked great on Sunday, and should only get better as he gets back into playing shape. Playing in this high octane Raiders office, expect more touchdowns to come for Lynch.
                                <br> DeMarco Murray was oddly quiet in this one, but I think this was an outlier. I think Tennessee establishes the run next week and Murray obviously will be the biggest beneficiary of that. No need to panic yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Eagles (30) vs. Redskins (17)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                Carson Wentz was excellent on Sunday, showing accuracy in the pocket, mobility and good arm strength against a good but not great Redskins secondary. He has a lot of options to play with, and I see a big second-year leap coming for Wentz.
                                <br> Kirk Cousins on the other hand did not look great. He was timid in the pocket and lacked the decision making we have come to expect from Mr. You Like That! I will give it a few more weeks to get Pryor acclimated, but if he continues to struggle, the entire offense will get a downgrade.
                                <br> Zach Ertz had 8 catches on all 8 of his targets for 93 yards, and could finally be entering into that elite class of tight ends. Start him with confidence moving forward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Colts (9) vs. Rams (46)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                With Andrew Luck still out for the foreseeable future, this Colts offense has almost no upside. I’m hesitant to start all of them right now, and that includes T.Y. Hilton who had only 3 catches for 57 yards. Try to stay away until Luck gets back.
                                <br> Todd Gurley’s fantasy line looks pretty good (96 total yards and a Touchdown) but he only averaged 2.1 ypc on 19 carries. That concerns me. The volume will be there, but he must become more efficient to enter back into that elite running back category.
                                <br> Jared Goff looked excellent on Sunday, throwing for 306 yards and a touchdown. I am not sold yet. He was playing against the worst defense in the league and had all day to throw. I want to see how he does over the next few weeks against the Redskins, 49ers, and Cowboys before labeling him legit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Panthers (23) vs. 49ers (3)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                Christian McCaffrey was very involved as expected, but with Jonathan Stewart being the red zone and goal line back, I think McCaffrey’s value outside of PPR is a bit limited. He is supremely talented and will have some great week, but I think weeks like Sunday (85 yards on 18 touches) will unfortunately be the norm early on for the Stanford product.
                                <br> Carlos Hyde only had 9 carries on Sunday but looked elite with them gaining 45 yards. He was also involved in the passing game, catching 6 passes for 32 yards. His improved pass catching ability should keep him on the field on all 3 downs, which should keep him active at all times moving forward. Let’s just hope Hoyer can keep them in enough games for Hyde’s full talent to go on display.
                                <br> Pierre Garcon was his usual self, catching 6 passes for 81 yards. He should be a PPR machine with Brian Hoyer behind center, and look for these stat lines to be the norm with some touchdowns sprinkled in here and there.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Giants (3) vs. Cowboys (19)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                The Giants need Odell Beckham back as soon as possible. Eli looked lost without him on Sunday night against a Cowboys defense that ranked in the bottom half against the pass last year. Not good.
                                <br> In a tough matchup against a stout Giants rush defense, Ezekiel Elliott was as solid as ever (24 carries, 104 yards, 5 catches 36 yards). As long as he is out there he is as elite as they come against any defense. Let’s just hope he is able to play all year.
                                <br> Evan Engram was the lone bright spot on a tough night for the Giants, catching 4 passes for 50 yards in his debut. He should be a constant target for Eli Manning moving forward, and could become a top-10 tight end by years end.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Saints (19) vs. Vikings (29) </strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                Stefon Diggs (7 catches, 93 yards) and Adam Thielen (9 catches, 157 yards) were tremendous on Monday night for the Vikings, and should provide great weekly value as long as Bradford is behind center.
                                <br> Dalvin Cook was excellent in his first game in the NFL. He looked explosive rushing for 127 yards and should become more involved in the passing game as the season moves along. I love him for the rest of the year.
                                <br> That Saints backfield on the other hand, yikes. Rookie Alvin Kamara led the team in carries with 7, Mark Ingram was active in the passing game during garbage time, and Adrian Peterson was busy arguing with Sean Payton on the sideline about getting the ball more. This is not a good situation in New Orleans, and I am not confident starting any of them at the moment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Chargers (21) vs. Broncos (24)</strong> </p>
                            <p>
                                As long as Trevor Siemian is behind center for the Broncos, both Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders are high-end WR 3’s at best. Their talent is much higher than that, but with Siemian crossing 200 yards passing rarely, the numbers just won’t be there for the duo.
                                <br> Keenan Allen only caught 5 of his 10 targets for 35 yards and a touchdown. Better days are ahead for Allen as the Broncos are one of the best defenses against the pass, and I still see a big season coming from the Cal product.
                                <br> C.J. Anderson doubled Jamaal Charles’ carries, and appears to be the guy. He ran well amassing 81 yards on 20 carries. With limited touchdown opportunities playing in that Denver Broncos offense, I like Anderson more as a high-end flex than RB2 at the moment.
                            </p>

                                <p><strong>TNF Fantasy Preview: Chiefs vs. Patriots</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    The defending Super Bowl champion Patriots hosting the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday night. As any avid fantasy football player understands, your work is not done just because you have drafted your team and week 1 has arrived. It is now time to look at the waiver wire, trades, and sleepers while everyone else just sits back and relax. This article will help aid you in making those tough week 1 decisions as you try to get your fantasy championship run started. There are obviously many fantasy relevant players on both sides of this opening Thursday Night Football tilt, and we here at the Fantasy Fuss want to help you with those difficult start/sit decisions along with baseline stat projections to support them. With that, let’s get started.</p>
                                <p>
                                </p><strong>Good Matchups</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Kareem Hunt Some of you might be thinking rookie running back in his first start on primetime against the defending champs? No thanks. But, with Spencer Ware out for what is likely the season, this is Hunt’s job. A talented runner who has displayed patience all preseason long, I see a good game coming from Hunt. He should be in on all 3 downs as he has exhibited excellent pass catching ability. The Patriots allowed 4.0 YPC to running backs last year, so they can be run on. I expect some good runs coming from Hunt, and with Alex Smith at QB I project some screens and check downs to help pad those stats for Hunt. Don’t be scared off of starting the rookie on Thursday night. Stat Projection: 22 rush, 85 yards; 4 receptions, 25 yards; 0.5 TD’s. Mike Gillislee Kansas City’s overall defense gets a lot more credit than it deserves. They finished in the bottom half against the run, and I think Gillislee has big touchdown potential here in week 1. The Patriots have historically had good scoring days in week 1 Thursday night games (28 points in 2015 vs. Steelers), and Gillislee should get all of the early downs and goal line work. As Legarrette Blount displayed last year, there will be plenty of goal line opportunities coming for Gillislee. He is definitely more talented than Blount, and has looked great in the limited preseason action he has seen. Start Gillislee with confidence week 1 and bank on a touchdown from the University of Florida product. Stat Projection: 18 rush, 70 yards; 2 receptions, 10 yards; 0.9 TD’s Brandin Cooks All reports this preseason are that Cooks is looking great and has built a strong rapport with Tom Brady already. Cooks should be the biggest beneficiary from the unfortunate season-ending injury to Julian Edelman, and Brady should look his way early and often. Cooks has top-5 WR upside in week 1 against the supremely overrated defense of the Kansas City Chiefs. Stat Projection: 6 catches, 85 yards; 0.7 TD’s</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Not So Good Matchups</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Travis Kelce The Patriots only allowed 6.2 ppg to tight ends in 2016, and that trend should continue into the 2017 season. Kelce is the most proven option in that Chiefs offense, and Belichick will likely key in on him in week 1. With Alex Smith at QB I foresee a conservative game plan coming which does not appease Kelce’s supreme down the field ability. You probably don’t have a much better option at tight end given the lack of talent at the position, but you need to temper your expectations for Kelce in week 1. Stat Projection: 5 catches, 50 yards; 0.3 TD’s Danny Amendola Amendola has seen his stock rise significantly Julian Edelman out. Many view him as the guy who will slide in and occupy that role, but I don’t see it that way. Amendola has never been a volume receiver, and in an offense where he is still at best the 4th option in the passing game I don’t foresee great production. Brady has a healthy Gronk, new weapon in Cooks, and an emerging Chris Hogan, which leaves Amendola likely next. The Chiefs were susceptible to downfield throws in 2016, and Brady should exploit that. That is not Amendola’s specialty, and the volume will likely not be there to justify starting him even in your flex. Proceed with caution on Amendola. Stat Projection: 4 catches, 45 yards; 0.2 TD’s</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Sleeper Pick</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Chris Hogan As referenced above with Amendola, Hogan has a prime opportunity with the injury to Julian Edelman. We saw just what Hogan can do in preseason week 3 where he caught two touchdowns and was a consistent downfield target for Brady. The Chiefs should give up some big plays on Thursday night, and Hogan could be the biggest beneficiary of that. While not a volume receiver himself, Hogan’s downfield ability combined with the opportunity make him an intriguing flex play. Consider Hogan for the big play touchdown upside in week 1. Stat Projection: 4 catches, 80 yards; 0.7 TD’s</p>
