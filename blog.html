                                     it is probably a good thing. I am only picking players that have high ceilings and good matchups for STARTS, players who have high floors and bad matchups for SITS, and players who I think can get 10 points or more for FLEX!</p>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Both the Houston Texans and Cincinnati Bengals had high expectations coming into the 2017 NFL season. Houston was coming off of a trip to the Divisional round in the playoffs and Cincinnati was getting a healthy Andy Dalton and A.J. Green back. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">

                                <p><strong>Houston Texans vs. Cincinnati Bengals</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    Both had horrendous week 1 losses as they combined for 7 points total between their respective games. It is now time to look forward, as both teams look to get back on track offensively Thursday night on NFL Network. We will look at players to be high on, not so high on, and a potential sleeper who could jump start your team for this week 2 in fantasy.</p>
                                <p>
                                </p><strong>Good Matchups</strong>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Andy Dalton</strong> This might be the one call that comes back to haunt me after week 2. I think Andy Dalton gets back on track Thursday night. The Houston Texans secondary did well last week, but it was against Blake Bortles (with no Allen Robinson by the way). Facing a much more potent offense with some legit weapons in Green, Eifert, and the running game, I think Dalton projects to have a solid game at home in week 2. Stat Projection: 25-35, 280 yards, 1.9 TD’s
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Lamar Miller</strong> The Bengals were gashed by the Ravens in the ground game last Sunday (150+ yards rushing) and I think that trend continues for week 2. With Deshaun Watson now entrenched as the starter, this should create some new running lanes for Miller. If he is not able to produce this week though, then you should probably look to trade him away. I am confident in him for this matchup though, and would not be afraid of starting him Thursday night. Stat Projection: 23 rush, 90 yards; 5 catches, 30 yards, 0.7 TD’s.
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Bengals D/ST</strong> I like Deshaun Watson a lot. But his first NFL start will come on primetime Thursday night against a solid Bengals secondary and a subpar offensive line. I think he will struggle moving the ball consistently as he gets his feet wet in the league, and could see some sacks and turnovers coming for the Bengals D. Feel confident rolling them out there week 2. Stat Projection: 18.5 points allowed, 280 total yards, 1.5 TD’s, 0.9 turnovers
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Not So Good Matchups</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Joe Mixon</strong> While Mixon is still the most talented back in that Bengals backfield, he only got 11 touches against the Ravens on Sunday which severely limits his potential impact. Marvin Lewis has always been conservative, especially in big games, and I think that trend continues week 2 unfortunately. Facing a stout Texans front will not help Mixon by any means, and until the guard is officially passed to Mixon only start him if you absolutely have to (sorry David Johnson owners). Stat Projection: 10 carries, 35 yards; 2 catches, 15 yards, 0.3 TD’s
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> Another highly touted rookie on this list, Watson gets his first NFL start on Thursday night. This is a tough matchup for Watson as Cincinnati ranked 11th in 2016 against the pass. Expect a conservative game plan from HC Bill O’Brien as they try to alleviate some of the pressure off of Watson. Don’t expect too much from the rookie on Thursday. Stat Projection: 18-25, 200 yards; 5 carries, 25 yards; 1.1 TD’s
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>A.J. Green</strong> While I like Andy Dalton to bounce back, I think Green will see double coverage most of the night, leaving the others (John Ross, Tyler Boyd, Tyler Eifert, Brandon Lafell) with the opportunity to produce. Houston was 2nd in the league against number 1 Wide Receivers in 2016 (via NFL.com), and that trend should continue here in week 2 with much of the same personnel along that Texan front 7 and secondary. Of course your starting Green because he is a stud, but temper your expectations for the superstar in week 2. Stat projection: 6 catches, 65 yards, 0.4 TD’s
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Sleeper Pick of the Week</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Giovani Bernard</strong> Truthfully, I don’t feel great about this call. I don’t see too many points being scored in this one with two excellent defenses and two struggling offenses. But If you dealing with an injury or needing a big play potential guy in your lineup, I think Bernard could provide a big play or two on Thursday night. Bernard looked the best of all the backs in that crowded Bengals backfield on Sunday, and I think Dalton looks his way often in the passing game as the Texans should be aggressive in their blitz packages. He won’t have the volume that you want, but if a big play is what you’re needing then Bernard is probably your best bet here.
                                    <br>Stat projection: 10 rushes, 45 yards; 6 catches, 50 yards, 0.5 TD’s</p>

                            Man oh man, how awesome it is to have football back in our lives officially. Finally, after months of preparation, we got football back in a large way over the weekend. There were many stars who showed up and even more who disappointed in week 1.  
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">

                                    There were also some players who emerged as potential stars and others who faltered in their 2017 debut. We will take a look at each game with some of provide some insight on what to do with these guys in the coming weeks.</p>
                                <p>
                                </p><strong>Chiefs (42) vs. Patriots (27)</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Kareem Hunt fumbled on his first NFL snap. He proceeded to follow that up with 250 yards and 3 TD’s. He looked every bit the part of an elite three-down back on Thursday night. I don’t think he has anywhere close to a game like this again, so if someone is willing to offer you a top-5 player for him then I would take that. Other than that, enjoy the ride.
                                    <br> Mike Gillislee’s fantasy stats look great. 15 carries and 3 touchdowns seem great but I am selling Gillislee moving forward. Tom Brady did not throw a touchdown and with a healthy Gronk I don’t see much value in Gillislee weekly, especially if he’s not scoring touchdowns.
                                    <br> You could tell Tom Brady missed Julian Edelman out there on Thursday night. He did not seem to have the same rhythm that were accustomed to seeing, and until he builds a stronger rapport with Brandin Cooks I think Brady’s ceiling is a bit capped.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Jets (12) vs. Bills (21)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    This probably goes without saying, but it is going to a rough season for the Jets. I don’t want any part of that offense, especially if Forte and Powell are splitting carries. There is not enough points going around in that offense to justify either one of them.
                                    <br> LeSean McCoy did what we expected him to, and still was incredibly impressive. Amassing 110 yards on the ground and 49 through the air, he one of the safest bets to put in your lineup going forward.
                                    <br> Tyrod Taylor does not get the credit he deserves. The Bills clearly don’t view him as the franchise guy moving forward, but he is a solid fantasy QB especially in 2-QB leagues. You could do a lot worse out there at QB (yes, I’m looking at you Scott Tolzein).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Seahawks (9) vs. Packers (17)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Not the start we all expected from Russell Wilson. I am not panicking though. He still has an elite tight end in Graham and possibly the best slot receiver in Baldwin, and has notoriously had slow starts. The big games will be there, so be patient with Wilson.
                                    <br> Eddie Lacy is BAD. SO, SO, BAD. Drop him, forget him, he never existed. Eddie who? I like Chris Carson but I think It’s Rawls or bust in the Seattle backfield running behind one of the worst offensive lines in the league.
                                    <br> Ty Montgomery was very impressive on Sunday. He ran with patience, power, and more importantly was out there on all 3 downs. He could have a huge year and I am excited to watch him going forward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Falcons (23) vs. Bears (17)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tarik Cohen displayed all of the abilities that saw him emerge as a viable backup to Jordan Howard. He scored a touchdown and was explosive in both the passing and running game. He’s not a between the tackles kind of back, but in a PPR he is an interesting sleeper to pick up.
                                    <br> If Tevin Coleman does not score touchdowns like he did on Sunday, then I don’t see much value in him except as a handcuff to Devonta Freeman. He probably won’t be justifying his draft position anytime soon.
                                    <br> If you haven’t seen Austin Hooper’s 88-yard touchdown grab, please go watch it now. After you have seen that awesomeness, Hooper presents an interesting value as a sleeper tight end. The volume will likely not be there, but he could develop into a consistent big play and red zone weapon for Matt Ryan going forward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Ravens (20) vs. Bengals (0)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Well Andy Dalton, that was rough. 5 turnovers and 0 points scored is horrendous, but I think Dalton will be fine. He has always struggled against the Ravens, and his track record shows that much better days are ahead.
                                    <br> Joe Mixon was almost nonexistent in this one, and I am a bit worried about him moving forward. I don’t see Jeremy Hill going anywhere (unfortunately) and Gio Bernard will always have a role as long as he is healthy. Mixon is undoubtedly their most talented back, but if the usage is not there, you will be disappointed.
                                    <br> Danny Woodhead was looking awesome, but as he usually does, went down and out with a hamstring injury. Buck Allen stepped in with 21 carries, but I like him as a sleeper moving forward. Terrance West is not a pass catcher, and Flacco loves checking it down, so Allen could provide some great value, especially in PPR.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Steelers (21) vs. Browns (18)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    If there is a Le’Veon Bell owner in your league that is discouraged by his 47 total yard week 1 performance, try to go get him. This was a weird game that saw bell only get 10 carries. I am not worried one bit about Bell.
                                    <br> I was high on Corey Coleman’s talent coming out of Baylor, but with injuries and other players emerging, Coleman has gone under the radar the past couple of years. He seems to have a strong rapport with Kizer, and I like him as a solid flex play week in and week out going forward.
                                    <br> Duke Johnson Jr. had 2 catches for 20 yards and not much else. Crowell overwhelmingly saw the majority of carries, but did not do much with those. I think Johnson will be fine, and would look to buy low on him if he continues his slow start.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Cardinals (23) vs. Lions (35)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    With David Johnson going on IR with a dislocated wrist, I am staying away from the Cardinals offense. Palmer has been bad for about 2 years now, and with no David Johnson I expect defenses to key all in on Larry Fitzgerald. Not good times in Arizona right now.
                                    <br> Kenny Golladay was a deep sleeper amongst many experts, and rewarded those with a 4 catch, 69 yard, 2 TD day. I love Golladay’s talent, but could see some becoming too high on him. Heck of a debut though.
                                    <br> Ameer Abdullah turned 15 carries into 30 yards, good for a whopping 2.0 ypc. Not. Good. With Theo Riddick improving in health and Dwayne Washington getting goal line work, I don’t see great returns for Abdullah moving forward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Jaguars (29) vs. Texans (7)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    There was much concern about Leonard Fournette missing 3 preseason games with a foot injury, but Fournette quickly put those concerns to bed with a 100- yard rushing performance. He ran tough, shifty, and was also active in the passing game, and should have an excellent rookie season ahead. Facing the Colts and Titans twice a year helps too.
                                    <br> Man, you’ve got to feel for DeAndre Hopkins. He’s gone through about 5 QB changes in 2 years, and outside of Brian Hoyer none of them seemed to realize they have a top-5 WR talent lining up on the outside. With Deshaun Watson the presumable starter moving forward (10 targets including 3 red zone ones from Watson in the second half), I like Hopkins potential moving forward. Rookie QB’s tend to rely on their star receivers, a la Cam Newton and Steve Smith his rookie year. You never know with the Texans though, so we shall see.
                                    <br> The Jaguars defense used to be a push over, but with new addition Calais Campbell (3 sacks in the first half alone) helping to man that front 4, they are no joke. This is a tough, deep defensive unit that should be factored into when making your lineup decisions in the future.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Raiders (26) vs. Titans (16)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Corey Davis is the biggest takeaway for me from this game. He was on the field early and often, and was a favorite target for Marcus Mariota, finishing with a respectable 6 catch, 69 yard performance. He will have his down weeks forsure, but I like the rookie as a solid flex play most weeks going forward.
                                    <br> How awesome is it to have Beast Mode back? He looked great on Sunday, and should only get better as he gets back into playing shape. Playing in this high octane Raiders office, expect more touchdowns to come for Lynch.
                                    <br> DeMarco Murray was oddly quiet in this one, but I think this was an outlier. I think Tennessee establishes the run next week and Murray obviously will be the biggest beneficiary of that. No need to panic yet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Eagles (30) vs. Redskins (17)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Carson Wentz was excellent on Sunday, showing accuracy in the pocket, mobility and good arm strength against a good but not great Redskins secondary. He has a lot of options to play with, and I see a big second-year leap coming for Wentz.
                                    <br> Kirk Cousins on the other hand did not look great. He was timid in the pocket and lacked the decision making we have come to expect from Mr. You Like That! I will give it a few more weeks to get Pryor acclimated, but if he continues to struggle, the entire offense will get a downgrade.
                                    <br> Zach Ertz had 8 catches on all 8 of his targets for 93 yards, and could finally be entering into that elite class of tight ends. Start him with confidence moving forward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Colts (9) vs. Rams (46)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    With Andrew Luck still out for the foreseeable future, this Colts offense has almost no upside. I’m hesitant to start all of them right now, and that includes T.Y. Hilton who had only 3 catches for 57 yards. Try to stay away until Luck gets back.
                                    <br> Todd Gurley’s fantasy line looks pretty good (96 total yards and a Touchdown) but he only averaged 2.1 ypc on 19 carries. That concerns me. The volume will be there, but he must become more efficient to enter back into that elite running back category.
                                    <br> Jared Goff looked excellent on Sunday, throwing for 306 yards and a touchdown. I am not sold yet. He was playing against the worst defense in the league and had all day to throw. I want to see how he does over the next few weeks against the Redskins, 49ers, and Cowboys before labeling him legit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Panthers (23) vs. 49ers (3)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Christian McCaffrey was very involved as expected, but with Jonathan Stewart being the red zone and goal line back, I think McCaffrey’s value outside of PPR is a bit limited. He is supremely talented and will have some great week, but I think weeks like Sunday (85 yards on 18 touches) will unfortunately be the norm early on for the Stanford product.
                                    <br> Carlos Hyde only had 9 carries on Sunday but looked elite with them gaining 45 yards. He was also involved in the passing game, catching 6 passes for 32 yards. His improved pass catching ability should keep him on the field on all 3 downs, which should keep him active at all times moving forward. Let’s just hope Hoyer can keep them in enough games for Hyde’s full talent to go on display.
                                    <br> Pierre Garcon was his usual self, catching 6 passes for 81 yards. He should be a PPR machine with Brian Hoyer behind center, and look for these stat lines to be the norm with some touchdowns sprinkled in here and there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Giants (3) vs. Cowboys (19)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Giants need Odell Beckham back as soon as possible. Eli looked lost without him on Sunday night against a Cowboys defense that ranked in the bottom half against the pass last year. Not good.
                                    <br> In a tough matchup against a stout Giants rush defense, Ezekiel Elliott was as solid as ever (24 carries, 104 yards, 5 catches 36 yards). As long as he is out there he is as elite as they come against any defense. Let’s just hope he is able to play all year.
                                    <br> Evan Engram was the lone bright spot on a tough night for the Giants, catching 4 passes for 50 yards in his debut. He should be a constant target for Eli Manning moving forward, and could become a top-10 tight end by years end.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Saints (19) vs. Vikings (29) </strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Stefon Diggs (7 catches, 93 yards) and Adam Thielen (9 catches, 157 yards) were tremendous on Monday night for the Vikings, and should provide great weekly value as long as Bradford is behind center.
                                    <br> Dalvin Cook was excellent in his first game in the NFL. He looked explosive rushing for 127 yards and should become more involved in the passing game as the season moves along. I love him for the rest of the year.
                                    <br> That Saints backfield on the other hand, yikes. Rookie Alvin Kamara led the team in carries with 7, Mark Ingram was active in the passing game during garbage time, and Adrian Peterson was busy arguing with Sean Payton on the sideline about getting the ball more. This is not a good situation in New Orleans, and I am not confident starting any of them at the moment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Chargers (21) vs. Broncos (24)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    As long as Trevor Siemian is behind center for the Broncos, both Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders are high-end WR 3’s at best. Their talent is much higher than that, but with Siemian crossing 200 yards passing rarely, the numbers just won’t be there for the duo.
                                    <br> Keenan Allen only caught 5 of his 10 targets for 35 yards and a touchdown. Better days are ahead for Allen as the Broncos are one of the best defenses against the pass, and I still see a big season coming from the Cal product.
                                    <br> C.J. Anderson doubled Jamaal Charles’ carries, and appears to be the guy. He ran well amassing 81 yards on 20 carries. With limited touchdown opportunities playing in that Denver Broncos offense, I like Anderson more as a high-end flex than RB2 at the moment.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>TNF Fantasy Preview: Chiefs vs. Patriots</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                     The defending Super Bowl champion Patriots hosting the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday night. As any avid fantasy football player understands, your work is not done just because you have drafted your team and week 1 has arrived. It is now time to look at the waiver wire, trades, and sleepers while everyone else just sits back and relax. This article will help aid you in making those tough week 1 decisions as you try to get your fantasy championship run started. There are obviously many fantasy relevant players on both sides of this opening Thursday Night Football tilt, and we here at the Fantasy Fuss want to help you with those difficult start/sit decisions along with baseline stat projections to support them. With that, let’s get started.</p>
                                <p>
                                </p><strong>Good Matchups</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Kareem Hunt Some of you might be thinking rookie running back in his first start on primetime against the defending champs? No thanks. But, with Spencer Ware out for what is likely the season, this is Hunt’s job. A talented runner who has displayed patience all preseason long, I see a good game coming from Hunt. He should be in on all 3 downs as he has exhibited excellent pass catching ability. The Patriots allowed 4.0 YPC to running backs last year, so they can be run on. I expect some good runs coming from Hunt, and with Alex Smith at QB I project some screens and check downs to help pad those stats for Hunt. Don’t be scared off of starting the rookie on Thursday night. Stat Projection: 22 rush, 85 yards; 4 receptions, 25 yards; 0.5 TD’s. Mike Gillislee Kansas City’s overall defense gets a lot more credit than it deserves. They finished in the bottom half against the run, and I think Gillislee has big touchdown potential here in week 1. The Patriots have historically had good scoring days in week 1 Thursday night games (28 points in 2015 vs. Steelers), and Gillislee should get all of the early downs and goal line work. As Legarrette Blount displayed last year, there will be plenty of goal line opportunities coming for Gillislee. He is definitely more talented than Blount, and has looked great in the limited preseason action he has seen. Start Gillislee with confidence week 1 and bank on a touchdown from the University of Florida product. Stat Projection: 18 rush, 70 yards; 2 receptions, 10 yards; 0.9 TD’s Brandin Cooks All reports this preseason are that Cooks is looking great and has built a strong rapport with Tom Brady already. Cooks should be the biggest beneficiary from the unfortunate season-ending injury to Julian Edelman, and Brady should look his way early and often. Cooks has top-5 WR upside in week 1 against the supremely overrated defense of the Kansas City Chiefs. Stat Projection: 6 catches, 85 yards; 0.7 TD’s</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Not So Good Matchups</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Travis Kelce The Patriots only allowed 6.2 ppg to tight ends in 2016, and that trend should continue into the 2017 season. Kelce is the most proven option in that Chiefs offense, and Belichick will likely key in on him in week 1. With Alex Smith at QB I foresee a conservative game plan coming which does not appease Kelce’s supreme down the field ability. You probably don’t have a much better option at tight end given the lack of talent at the position, but you need to temper your expectations for Kelce in week 1. Stat Projection: 5 catches, 50 yards; 0.3 TD’s Danny Amendola Amendola has seen his stock rise significantly Julian Edelman out. Many view him as the guy who will slide in and occupy that role, but I don’t see it that way. Amendola has never been a volume receiver, and in an offense where he is still at best the 4th option in the passing game I don’t foresee great production. Brady has a healthy Gronk, new weapon in Cooks, and an emerging Chris Hogan, which leaves Amendola likely next. The Chiefs were susceptible to downfield throws in 2016, and Brady should exploit that. That is not Amendola’s specialty, and the volume will likely not be there to justify starting him even in your flex. Proceed with caution on Amendola. Stat Projection: 4 catches, 45 yards; 0.2 TD’s</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Sleeper Pick</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Chris Hogan As referenced above with Amendola, Hogan has a prime opportunity with the injury to Julian Edelman. We saw just what Hogan can do in preseason week 3 where he caught two touchdowns and was a consistent downfield target for Brady. The Chiefs should give up some big plays on Thursday night, and Hogan could be the biggest beneficiary of that. While not a volume receiver himself, Hogan’s downfield ability combined with the opportunity make him an intriguing flex play. Consider Hogan for the big play touchdown upside in week 1. Stat Projection: 4 catches, 80 yards; 0.7 TD’s</p>

                        <h3> The Zero RB / RB Backfield Strategy</h3>
                        <p> July 27, 2017 Taylor Casey</p>

                            There are many different strategies to consider when it comes to fantasy football and drafting a competitive team. Strategies have a wide variance from zero wr, early qb, best available, and one of my personal favorites that we will cover today and that is the zero rb strategy.

                                    <p>While you may not win your fantasy league at the draft you can definitely lose it if you don’t know what you’re doing. Depending on where you draft is also a main factor in considering how you’re going to draft, and with this strategy you want to draft anywhere from picks 6 -12 this year. This strategy is one of my favorites this year and its mainly because everybody is in love with running backs…… and they’re absolutely getting robbed paying that much!</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In most fantasy leagues you are only required to start 2 RB’s 3 WR’s and FLEX so why would you waste an early pick on a position that you can plug in play. Now I’m not telling you to pass on any of the big three RB’s, if they’re available don’t hesitate and grab them, but after the top 3 backs are off the board the decline in talent is too much for me to risk a 1st rd pick on them. That’s why THIS YEAR you need to definitely draft wide receivers early and often.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        What exactly is the zero running back strategy? It is exactly what it sounds like! With this strategy you want to avoid running back for the first 3-4 rounds of the draft possibly even longer depending who’s left on the draft board. So if you apply this strategy and say you can grab AJ Green at the 9th pick and then come back and grab T.Y. Hilton, Michael Thomas, or Amari Cooper the 2nd round? I’ll take that all day over drafting someone like Melvin Gordon (who is one of my busts this year) or Jordan Howard who is another bust candidate. Then in the 3rd round you can grab someone like Demaryius Thomas, Keenan Allen, or Jarvis Landry who in ppr will outscore RB’s going around that same value, that’s a no brainer to me. If you’re starting your draft off this way I like your chances of being a top contender in your league.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now another strategy to employ when you are using the ZERO RB is the team backfield strategy which is the strategy I use. It is just as it sounds, when you start your draft off in the first 4 rounds and you’ve taken your 4 stud WR’s it is now time to start grabbing RB’s and you want to grab backfields such as like New England, Detroit, Cincinnati, New Orleans, Seattle, Broncos, and Redskins. When you grab a backfield you’re basically grabbing all the fantasy points that will come from those backs and you want to target good offenses with points to be had like the teas I named earlier. So what you would hypothetically would do is grab Mike Gillislee in the 5th rd, then grab James White in the 9th rd, then take a shot on someone like Dion Lewis or Rex Burkhead in the last rd. Below is a list of backfields to grab and the average of where they’re being selected.</p>

                            Every year, fantasy football players turn away from logic and projections to fall in love with a potential breakout star. Some take these “potential stars” as early as the 3rd round, while others wait until after the 6th to take their stab.

                                <p>Wherever you take your Potential Star, you are turning your head to realistic projections and dreaming of something bigger and better for the player. Below, is one of our Breakout Candidates for the 2017 Season. Stay tuned weekly for player profiles such as these!</p>
                                <p>
                                    Yes, he’s a rookie. Yes, he seems to be prone to injury. Yes, he’s in a crowded situation.. However, John Ross is a polarizing talent worthy of top tier fantasy football consideration. He is currently coming off the board in the mid to late 11th round and the 57th WR taken. Ross broke a combine record in the 40 yard dash with his blazing time of 4.22. Most think of Ross as a downfield one trick pony, yet he is much more rounded. Some scouts had him as the top WR coming into the draft. Our favorite quote from a scout about Ross was “Most people think he can just burn, but he can stop too”. Being able to stop is everything in the NFL. Ross is able to stop on a dime and create enough separation to get open and break HUGE gains for his team with the ball in his hands. Scouts said he may be the best route runner in the draft other than Corey Davis and is definitely the best at creating separation.
                                    <p> John Ross will find himself trying to create separation between him and his fellow WR’s in training camp and has a chance to be AJ Green’s top running mate. If he does, he could find himself in WR2 or 3 territory. For the last 4 seasons, AJ Green’s running mate has averaged; 97 Targets, 59 catches, 795 yards receiving, and 6 touchdowns. That stat line unchanged would have ranked 40th overall for WR just under Desean Jackson, Sterling Shepard, and Cameron Meredith to name a few. </p>
                                    <p>All of which were fantastic WR3’s throughout the season in PPR leagues. We think John Ross can surpass the 4 year average of AJ Green’s running mate. With his speed, route running, ability to create separation, and his playmaking skills after the catch… John Ross can be Brandin Cooks esque this year. If John Ross gets the nod for AJ’s top running mate, we could see him in the WR2 territory. Our projections have him at 69 catches, 900 yards, and 7 TD’s. That would land him smack dab in the middle of WR2 range in a PPR league. This is totally possible given the fact that Andy Dalton is a more than compatible QB, the Bengals have recommitted to the run game by drafting Mixon which will leave Ross in great 1 on 1 situations, and that AJ demands all the attention… all of the time! If Ross can stay healthy…. Watch out!

                                    <p><strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> – Watson seems to be overlooked by most analyst. They will respect his pedigree but give him a mid to late round grade.. some even say he’s not a first rounder. We firmly believe in Watson, we even have him going in the top 10. There are two spots we’d love to see him land in the top 10.. the first spot is Jacksonville at 4. You may think to yourself.. why do that with Bortles there.. some may think.. thank god get Bortles out of there.. either way, Watson could thrive in Jax. The WR core lead by Allen Robinson would benefit from a change at QB and Watson has the arm to showcase A Rob’s talent! The second would be a proposed trade by the Cardinals jumping up into the top 10 or 11 and taking Watson before the Browns could at 12. Bruce Arians would love to sit Watson behind Palmer this year and let him learn. Palmer will likely retire soon and Watson could be his replacement.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Corey Davis</strong> – Davis has been touted as the most NFL ready receiver in this draft. With a size comparison to that of an AJ Green and foot speed to match, Davis could be in for a big year if given the right situation. His frame alone will make him a red zone / end zone target right out of the gate! Ideal fits for fantasy purposes are – Titans, Bills, Chargers, and Cardinals. I would personally like to see him go to the Cardinals!</p>
                                    <p><strong>Mike Williams</strong> – He’s not the fastest guy in the world and he doesn’t jump out of the gym.. but he has elite ball skills and is an instant red zone/end zone target for any team in the NFL. Ideal spots for Williams looks to be the Titans at 5, Chargers at 7, Bills at 10, or Cardinals at 13. Our best educated guess is that he goes to the Bills to play alongside Sammy Watkins. Williams would bring much-needed talent to a depleted WR core and would help Watkins be more productive. In the Bills offense, Williams could lead the teams WR’s in TD’s year one! For fantasy purposes… I would love to see him go the Bills or the Titans.</p>
                                    <p><strong>John Ross</strong> – Ross is a burner… yet he does more. He has been compared to D Jax and I like that comparison.. however, I think he can be a bit more than just a D Jax type of burner. Ross will likely end up with a team in the first round. He has been pegged as a mid to late first round draft pick. A lot of people have linked Ross with the Ravens, which isn’t a bad fit at all! I would love to see Ross land in Baltimore or Washington.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Leonard Fournette</strong> – Drawing comparisons to AP, Fournette is the clear-cut favorite to be the first RB off the board come draft day. Early picks with RB needs are Jacksonville at 4, and Carolina at 8. Either of these two teams in the top 10 would be a great fit for the LSU star. For fantasy purposes, Carolina seems to be the best option. He would provide a tremendous amount of talent to a team in desperate need of another playmaker other than Cam Newton. He would likely split carries with Jonathan Stewart, with a great chance of beating him out early in the season, for lead back duties. No matter where he goes, Fournette is a top 2 Dynasty pick and draftable in rounds 3-5 regardless of his landing spot in redraft leagues.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Christian McCaffrey </strong>– This guy can do it all. He impressed in the combine and at his pro day and likely helped his stock! He has been viewed as a mid to late round pick, yet is rumored to be a top 10 pick in the draft. Ideal fits for fantasy purposes would be – Colts, Jags, Bucs, and even the Saints. Our pick would be the Bucs, who are in need of a RB presence with the news of Doug Martin emerging. Doug Martin could be cut and that would leave the team with Charles Simms and Peyton Barber.. which we could see McCaffrey taking over quickly!</p>
                                    <p><strong>Dalvin Cook</strong> – Cook may be the most overrated running back in the class if you just look at his measurable’s. Yet, the tape says otherwise. It is important to note that 40 running backs have completed the three cone drill with a 7.29 second time or worse.. the only successful starter to do so out of the 40 is Demarco Murray. This obviously is just a drill and may not translate to the field 100% but it’s worth noting. Cooks potential landing spots include the Panthers, Bucs, Colts, and the Redskins. We’d love to see him land in Washington! For fantasy purposes, this would be the ideal spot for him. Kirk is playing at such a high level with little talent around him other than Jordan Reed. A guy like Cook could boost Kirk to the next level. Cook can catch passes and run downhill.. we could see him taking over Fat Rob and company day 1!</p>
                                    <p><strong>Joe Mixon</strong> – He’s been the center of adversity this year after a video released of him punching a woman in 2015.. yet, he may be the most talented Running Back in this entire class. He will likely slide down the board because of his wrong doing but his landing spots may be better because of it! We’d love to see Mixon drafted by the Bengals at 2.09!! Mixon would immediately compete for playing time behind Gio and Jeremy Hill. Hill has been disappointing for the last two years and the Bengals may not extend his rookie deal that expires in 2018. With Hill out of the picture.. Mixon could dominate carries leaving Gio to do what he does best.. catch the ball and make defenders miss in space on 3rd down!</p>

                                    <p><strong>O.J. Howard</strong> – This guy is crazy talented. He has elite speed at the TE position and the size / ability to Block. Howard has been rumored to go as high as top 5 and as late as 15-20. I think he will end up with the Broncos at 20. It isn’t really a glaring need for the Broncos but they could use a talent like Howard every single down. Whether it be blocking, taking a screen which OC McCoy loves to do, or play in the middle of the field and create space for whoever the starting QB is. Bottom line is, wherever he goes.. he is going to make an impact very quickly.</p>
