                                <h4><strong>Quarter Backs</strong></h4>
                                <p>
                                   <strong>Trevor Siemian - DEN: 1-3% FAAB Budget:</strong> Siemian has looked like a completely different player this year. Offensive line play has improved and the Running Game has vastly improved with the resurgence of CJ Anderson and Jamaal Charles. Thru 2 games, Siemian has thrown 6 passing TD’s and has even rushed for 1 TD. He is averaging over 220 yards per game. His next three are hardly scary, @ Buffalo - Home vs. Oak, and Home vs. NYG. Buffalo has looked good thru 2 Games but has only played one Viable QB in Cam Newton who was injured and lost Greg Olsen during the game. Oakland gave up 2 passing TD’s to the Jets week 2 and the Giants have given up 6 total passing TD’s thru 2 weeks.</p>
                                   <p>
                                       <strong>Deshaun Watson - HOU: 1-2% FAAB Budget:</strong> Watson came in at Halftime week 1 and ended the game with 8 FP scoring 1 PATD. Week 2 Watson Started and while he didn't impress thru the air, he ended with 18.95 FP mostly due in part to his 67 yard TD run right before half time. Watson has developed Chemistry with Hopkins and his ability to keep the play alive / run when needed.. makes him intriguing for QB Streamers. His next 2 games are workable. @ NWE then home against the Titans. Houston will likely be down against the Patriots and could use his legs more often than not to try and Keep up with Brady and Company.
                                   </p>
                                   <h4><strong>Running Backs</strong></h4><p>
                                       Chris Carson, D’onta Foreman, and Alvin Kamara should already be owned. If not, they are all worth 10-15% or more of your FAAB Budget.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                       <strong>Same Perine - WAS: 8-11% FAAB Budget:</strong> Perine should already be owned in most deep leagues but if he's not, he's a priority this week. Rob Kelley injured his ribs in week 2 and will likely miss week 3. This is Perine’s chance to take over. Once Kelley went down week 2, Perine carried the load finished with 67 yards on 21 carries. It is worth noting that 3rd down specialist Chris Thompson only logged 3 carries while vastly outproducing serine due in part to large runs for TD’s. Perine will carry the load week 3 against Oakland who can be run on after giving up 95 yards in week 1 on the ground and 126 against the Jets in week 2.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                       <strong>Chris Johnson - ARI: 5-7% FAAB Budget:</strong> David Johnson is gone until week 12 at a minimum. Chris Johnson was brought in after week 1 and played 26% of the snaps after the Cardinals named Kerwyn Williams their starter, who played 27%. Bruce Arians has admitted that Chris Johnson will move up the depth chart going forward. He finished week 1 with 44 rushing yards on 11 carries. He may be their best bet going forward on early downs while <strong>Andre Ellington</strong> will capture most if not all of 3rd down work. Andre Ellington is also worth a look as he finished with 5 receiving targets and 3 receptions week 2. Ellington plays 45% of the snaps in a close game but couldn't do much with his opportunities.
                                   </p>
                                   <h4><strong>Wide Receivers</strong></h4>
                                   <p>
                                       Tyler Lockett, Marqise Lee, Allen Hurns, Kendall Wright, and Devin Funchess should already be owned in deeper leagues. If they are not, you could expect to pay 9-12% or more of your FAAB budget for all of the names mentioned.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                       <strong>J.J. Nelson - ARI: 9-12% FAAB Budget:</strong> With the news of John Brown already being ruled out of week 3, JJ is a must have. Before entering week 2, Nelson has averaged 13+ FPPG when John Brown is not in the lineup. He finished week 2 with 22 FP in a PPR format. He had 7 targets, 5 receptions, 120 yards, and a TD. He will likely take over the number 2 role even if John Brown comes back after posting two great performances back to back. There is talk that John Brown could miss an extended amount of time. If that is the case, I am comfortable saying that Nelson will be a solid WR3 and or Flex moving forward.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                       <strong>Rashard Higgins - CLE: 8-11% FAAB Budget:</strong> With Corey Coleman going down in week 2 for 6-8 weeks, Higgins will likely be the Browns new WR1. Britt has disappointed and as a result, the Practice squad player who was just recently called up... Higgins, will be a factor. Higgins finished with 11 targets, 7 receptions, and 95 yards! He draws a great matchup in week 3 against the Colts who were just torched by JJ Nelson in week 2.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                       <strong>Jermaine Kearse - NYJ: 5-7% FAAB Budget:</strong> Kearse has done nothing but impress with his short time in New York. He now has 11 receptions, 123 yards and 2 TD’s thru 2 weeks of action. He has taken over as the WR1 and will continue to be targeting going forward as he develops trust with McCown. He will draw two tougher matchups in weeks 3 and 4 against the Dolphins and Jaguars, but he is the Jets best option at WR and they will likely be down in both games.
                                   </p>
                                   <h4><strong>Tight Ends</strong></h4>
                                   <p>
                                       <strong>Zach Miller - CHI: 2-4% FAAB Budget:</strong> Miller has been a targeted consistently after the Bears have lost both Cameron Meredith and Kevin White for the season. He has received 15 targets turning those into 10 catches thru 2 weeks of play. Expect Miller to continue to receive a large amount of the target share moving forward due mostly in part to not having anyone else. He is the security blanket and a redbone threat ( if the Bears ever get in the Redzone ).
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                       <strong>Austin Sefarian-Jenkins - NYJ: 1-3% FAAB Budget:</strong> After serving a 2 game suspension, ASJ is back for week 3. He is a total wild card in a bad offense. That being said, he could help you win your league... reports in training camp pegged him as the best player on the field and un-guard-able. He’ll draw the 3rd easiest schedule for TE’s in the next 4 weeks.
                                   </p>

                        <h3>Week 2 Takeaways</h3>
                        <p>Sept 19th, 2017 Marcel Hull</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>In what was a rather low-scoring week 1 for fantasy owners, many were eager to get to week 2 to see players either bounce back from disappointing week 1 performances or build upon strong debuts and entrench themselves as fantasy forces for their teams.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">

                                <h4><strong>Texans vs. Bengals</strong></h4>
                                <p>
                                   <strong>DeAndre Hopkins</strong> was predictably peppered with targets, and while he was rather inefficient (7 catches for 73 yards on 13 targets) I am confident in him going forward. As <strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> becomes more confident and his rapport builds with Hopkins, there should be some big production coming for the Clemson product.</p>
                                   <p>
                                       Right now is a prime time to buy low on <strong>A.J. Green</strong>. If you can find an owner that is panicking after another mediocre outing, go get him as quickly as you can. Even at his “worst” he is getting you 60-70 yards each game, and the Bengals eventually have to score a touchdown right? When they do, he will be the biggest beneficiary and I am not worried one bit about Green.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                       On the opposite end of the spectrum, I would be looking to sell <strong>Lamar Miller</strong>. He was once again pedestrian on the ground, and didn’t sniff a touchdown. With <strong>D’Onta Foreman</strong> getting more carries and being more active in the offense, I don’t think Miller will come anywhere close to providing the 2nd to 3rd round value that you had to take him at. 
                                   </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Dolphins vs. Chargers</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                    <strong>Jay Ajayi</strong> was every bit the workhorse back that we predicted him to be, and was very impressive in his first regular season game. Rushing for over 120 yards on 28 carries, Ajayi could be this year's DeMarco Murray. He is one of the safest bets in an era where there aren’t many of them.
                                </p>
                                   <p>
                                    As a fan here, congrats to Antonio Gates for breaking the Tight End touchdown record. He has had a remarkable career and has always played with respect and toughness that I will always appreciate. His protege <strong>Hunter Henry</strong> caught 7 balls for 80 yards and bounced back nicely from a tough week 1. I am excited to see what he does in week 3. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I was a bit worried about <strong>Jarvis Landry</strong> this year. He had a new quarterback in Jay Cutler and an emerging <strong>DeVante Parker</strong>, but he saw 15 targets, catching 13 of them for 80 yards. He should once again be a PPR machine, but I like Parker for the touchdown upside in Standard going forward.
                                    </p>
                                        <h4><strong>Jets vs. Raiders</strong></h4>     
                                   <p>
                                    As long as Josh McCown is playing behind center, <strong>Jermaine Kearse</strong> is an interesting weekly flex play. WIth 3 TD’s in two games now, Kearse is the preferred option in an offense that will be throwing a lot as it will be playing catch up all year. You could do much worse at the flex position right now.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      <strong>Michael Crabtree</strong> is proving once again to be an elite WR2 in this league and those who doubted him again this offseason (I am guilty of this) were just flat out wrong. 6, catches 80 yards and 3 TD’s are lines we expected from Amari Cooper, and Crabtree now looks like the preferred target in that Raiders offense. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      This is your weekly stay away from the Jets running back segment. They are splitting carries evenly, and with little touchdown upside, I see no benefit in having either <strong>Matt Forte</strong> or <strong>Bilal Powell</strong>
                                       in your lineup. 
                                  </p>
                                  <h4><strong>49ers vs. Seahawks</strong></h4>
                                  <p>
                                      I’m continuing to be patient with <strong>Russell Wilson</strong>, but if he struggles again at Tennessee in week 3, I will be concerned with him moving forward. That offensive line is horrendous, and they are going to have to figure some things out if they are to get back to their explosive ways. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      <strong>Carlos Hyde</strong> had a tremendous game, rushing for over 120 yards and being actively involved in the passing game. If <strong>Bryan Hoyer</strong> can get anything going in the passing game and opens those running lanes up even more for Hyde, he could be in line for a huge season. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                      WIth Eddie Lacy being a surprise scratch and Thomas Rawls available, many thought he would be the guy. But it now appears that <strong>Chris Carson</strong> is that guy, and has looked powerful while doing it. Running behind that line leaves a lot to be desired, but as a waiver wire pickup Carson could prove valuable to fantasy teams from this point on. 
                                  </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Browns vs.Ravens</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Javorious “Buck” Allen</strong> out-touched <strong>Terrance West</strong> in both the rushing and passing game, and is clearly the most effective back in this offense. A dynamic dual-threat running back with a quarterback who loves to check down, Allen could be on his way to a RB2 level season. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If DeShone Kizer continues to miss playing time, then Kevin Hogan should continue to target <strong>Duke Johnson Jr.</strong> and his usage should justify a weekly flex option moving forward if that’s the case. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Bills vs. Panthers</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        With <strong>Greg Olsen</strong> likely to miss a significant time with a broken foot, <strong>Cam Newton</strong> is best used as a matchup dependent QB2. With his rushing total a fraction of what it once was (only 27 yards in week 2), he won’t provide enough value through the air to be your QB1. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> finished with 10 yards on 8 carries, but should provide enough value in the passing game (34 yards on 4 catches) to be a weekly RB2 and a flex play in standard.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I still like <strong>Tyrod Taylor</strong> as a sleeper QB despite the rough start. He will produce enough rushing (8 carries, 55) to make up for his passing deficiencies, and should still be fine in matchups with plus defenses. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Cardinals vs. Colts</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Carson Palmer’s</strong> stats ended up looking pretty good, but he had to play catch up to get the Cards into overtime vs. the colts (who were torched by <strong>Jared Goff</strong> by the way). He did not look great, and if it takes him overtime to amass 15+ fantasy points against the Colts then it’s not looking too good for him. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Jack Doyle</strong> seems to be Jacoby Brissett’s favorite weapon in this Colts offense (8 catches for 79 yards), and as long as Brissett is in at QB, Doyle should be a weekly starter going forward. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Titans vs. Jaguars</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                      <strong>DeMarco Murray</strong> only got 9 carries on Sunday, and after the game it was revealed he was dealing with a hamstring injury. This opened the door for <strong>Derrick Henry</strong> (14 carries, 92 yards and a TD) and he was very impressive. At the very least he will continue to eat into Murray’s carries and could be entering into weekly flex consideration.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        14 carries for 40 yards might be a line we see a few more time for <strong>Leonard Fournette</strong>. Blake Bortles was horrendous in this game (what’s new?) and defenses will continue to key in on Fournette. He is talented enough and active enough in the passing game to be just fine, but he will have some games like this. Just hope he keeps getting into the end zone.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Marcus Mariota</strong> was again not great (215 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT), and has a tough week 3 matchup with the Seahawks coming to town. Once this rough stretch is over though, I like Mariota and think some positive regression is on the way. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Eagles vs. Chiefs </strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Kareem Hunt</strong> continues to dazzle in his rookie campaign, amassing 81 yards and 2 TD’s on the ground and an additional 28 yards through the air. He is a weekly RB1 and could be on his way to winning some 2017 fantasy leagues.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Eagles have a non-existent running game through the first couple of weeks, which means <strong>Carson Wentz</strong> will be throwing a ton, and I like him as a weekly top 10 QB moving forward.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Speaking of that horrible Eagles running attack (107 total yards in week 2), <strong>LeGarette Blount</strong> is probably droppable at this point, and outside of Sproles in a PPR league, no one in that backfield is worth owning, let alone starting. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Patriots vs. Saints</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Tom Brady</strong> bounced back in a large way on Sunday, throwing for 450 yards and 3 TD’s. Granted, it was against a Saints defense that was lit up by Sam Bradford last week, but it was encouraging to see the Pats get back on track.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Adrian Peterson</strong> is borderline droppable at this point as he hasn’t amassed over 40 yards in either of 2 games so far. Father time might have finally caught up with AP. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While everyone else was catching touchdowns and amassing yardage from Tom Brady, <strong>Brandin Cooks</strong> finished with 2 catches for 37 yards. I think he is an interesting buy low target, and would see if I can get him on the cheap. The explosive games are coming. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Vikings vs. Steelers</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        If Sam Bradford continues to miss games, <strong>Stefon Diggs</strong> (27 yards) and <strong>Adam Thielen</strong> (44 yards) are probably best suited as flex plays. Let’s hope Bradford is able to suit up in week 3. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Martavis Bryant</strong> shook off some week 1 rust to the tune of 91 yards and a touchdown. As this offense heats up, look for some more big games coming from Bryant.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Bears vs. Buccaneers</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Jordan Howard</strong> only say 9 carries for 7 yards, but has been dealing with an injured shoulder (was seen in an arm sling after the game). If he forced to miss any time, <strong>Tarik Cohen</strong> (8 catches in week 2)  enters RB2 category as an elite pass catching running back with enough between the tackles burst to be productive. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Jacquizz Rodgers</strong> was not very efficient with his 19 carries, but 67 yards and a touchdown are perfect for a weekly flex play. The volume should justify a weekly start at least until Doug Martin comes back from suspension. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Mike Evans</strong> (97 yards and a TD) has officially entered the Elite WR1 tier, and *Hot Take Alert* might be even more valuable that Julio Jones and Odell Beckham going forward. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Cowboys vs. Broncos</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>C.J. Anderson</strong> (150+ yards and 2 TD’s) looked excellent on Sunday, running with burst and being a force in the passing game. If he can stay healthy and the offensive line continues to block well, I like him as a high end RB2 moving forward. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Dez Bryant</strong> saw 16 targets, yet caught only 7 of those for 59 yards. He did score a touchdown though, and I think this was just a tough matchup for the Cowboys offense all together. Better days are ahead for the stud receiver. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Trevor Siemian</strong> looked great on Sunday, finishing with 230 yards, 4 TD’s, and a 116.0 passer rating. I think this was more a statement on the Cowboys lackluster defense than Siemian’s ability. He is not throwing the ball deep at all, and I still don’t project much value outside of 2 QB leagues moving forward. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Redskins vs. Rams</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Todd Gurley</strong> ran with the power and patience that saw him as a top-5 pick last year. Averaging 5.5 YPC and a touchdown along with 48 yards and a touchdown through the air, Gurley looks to be finding his elite form once again. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>“Fat” Rob Kelley</strong> looked great Sunday (12 carries for 78 yards) until he went down with an injury. <strong>Semaje Perine</strong> came in and got 21 carries, but only turned that into 67 yards. If Kelley misses time, I think Perine does offer some interest value as a volume flex play in week 3.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> only received 2 targets on Sunday. He caught both for 30 yards, but if he doesn't get more looks his way, I can’t justify having him in your lineup every week. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Packers vs. Falcons</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Ty Montgomery</strong> was once again effecting in week 2, amassing 110 yards and 2 total touchdowns. He is out there on all 3 downs, and regardless of matchup will be a top-12 RB for me moving forward.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Tevin Coleman</strong> ran well, but once again was dependent on a goal-line touchdown to be a startable option. The touchdowns won’t always be there and when they aren’t you won’t be happy having him in your lineup. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Lions vs. Giants</strong></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Evan Engram</strong> was the lone bright spot on a tough night for the Giants offense. He saw 7 targets, catching 4 of them for 49 yards and a touchdown. With the tight end landscape being the way that it is, he is probably a startable weekly option.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Ameer Abdullah</strong> ran well (86 yards, 5.1 YPC) against a stout Giants defensive line. He will still give up carries and third-down work to <strong>Theo Riddick</strong>, but this was an encouraging sign for Abdullah. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Those that thought <strong>Kenny Golladay</strong> would continue his hot week 1 start saw him crash hard back to earth with 1 catch for 8 yards. He still has plenty of talent and good games will be there, but it will be impossible to predict when.
                                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Both the Houston Texans and Cincinnati Bengals had high expectations coming into the 2017 NFL season. Houston was coming off of a trip to the Divisional round in the playoffs and Cincinnati was getting a healthy Andy Dalton and A.J. Green back. </p>

                                <p><strong>Houston Texans vs. Cincinnati Bengals</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    Both had horrendous week 1 losses as they combined for 7 points total between their respective games. It is now time to look forward, as both teams look to get back on track offensively Thursday night on NFL Network. We will look at players to be high on, not so high on, and a potential sleeper who could jump start your team for this week 2 in fantasy.</p>
                                <p>
                                </p><strong>Good Matchups</strong>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Andy Dalton</strong> This might be the one call that comes back to haunt me after week 2. I think Andy Dalton gets back on track Thursday night. The Houston Texans secondary did well last week, but it was against Blake Bortles (with no Allen Robinson by the way). Facing a much more potent offense with some legit weapons in Green, Eifert, and the running game, I think Dalton projects to have a solid game at home in week 2. Stat Projection: 25-35, 280 yards, 1.9 TD’s
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Lamar Miller</strong> The Bengals were gashed by the Ravens in the ground game last Sunday (150+ yards rushing) and I think that trend continues for week 2. With Deshaun Watson now entrenched as the starter, this should create some new running lanes for Miller. If he is not able to produce this week though, then you should probably look to trade him away. I am confident in him for this matchup though, and would not be afraid of starting him Thursday night. Stat Projection: 23 rush, 90 yards; 5 catches, 30 yards, 0.7 TD’s.
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Bengals D/ST</strong> I like Deshaun Watson a lot. But his first NFL start will come on primetime Thursday night against a solid Bengals secondary and a subpar offensive line. I think he will struggle moving the ball consistently as he gets his feet wet in the league, and could see some sacks and turnovers coming for the Bengals D. Feel confident rolling them out there week 2. Stat Projection: 18.5 points allowed, 280 total yards, 1.5 TD’s, 0.9 turnovers
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Not So Good Matchups</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Joe Mixon</strong> While Mixon is still the most talented back in that Bengals backfield, he only got 11 touches against the Ravens on Sunday which severely limits his potential impact. Marvin Lewis has always been conservative, especially in big games, and I think that trend continues week 2 unfortunately. Facing a stout Texans front will not help Mixon by any means, and until the guard is officially passed to Mixon only start him if you absolutely have to (sorry David Johnson owners). Stat Projection: 10 carries, 35 yards; 2 catches, 15 yards, 0.3 TD’s
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> Another highly touted rookie on this list, Watson gets his first NFL start on Thursday night. This is a tough matchup for Watson as Cincinnati ranked 11th in 2016 against the pass. Expect a conservative game plan from HC Bill O’Brien as they try to alleviate some of the pressure off of Watson. Don’t expect too much from the rookie on Thursday. Stat Projection: 18-25, 200 yards; 5 carries, 25 yards; 1.1 TD’s
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>A.J. Green</strong> While I like Andy Dalton to bounce back, I think Green will see double coverage most of the night, leaving the others (John Ross, Tyler Boyd, Tyler Eifert, Brandon Lafell) with the opportunity to produce. Houston was 2nd in the league against number 1 Wide Receivers in 2016 (via NFL.com), and that trend should continue here in week 2 with much of the same personnel along that Texan front 7 and secondary. Of course your starting Green because he is a stud, but temper your expectations for the superstar in week 2. Stat projection: 6 catches, 65 yards, 0.4 TD’s
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Sleeper Pick of the Week</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Giovani Bernard</strong> Truthfully, I don’t feel great about this call. I don’t see too many points being scored in this one with two excellent defenses and two struggling offenses. But If you dealing with an injury or needing a big play potential guy in your lineup, I think Bernard could provide a big play or two on Thursday night. Bernard looked the best of all the backs in that crowded Bengals backfield on Sunday, and I think Dalton looks his way often in the passing game as the Texans should be aggressive in their blitz packages. He won’t have the volume that you want, but if a big play is what you’re needing then Bernard is probably your best bet here.
                                    <br>Stat projection: 10 rushes, 45 yards; 6 catches, 50 yards, 0.5 TD’s</p>

                            Man oh man, how awesome it is to have football back in our lives officially. Finally, after months of preparation, we got football back in a large way over the weekend. There were many stars who showed up and even more who disappointed in week 1.  
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion">

                                    There were also some players who emerged as potential stars and others who faltered in their 2017 debut. We will take a look at each game with some of provide some insight on what to do with these guys in the coming weeks.</p>
                                <p>
                                </p><strong>Chiefs (42) vs. Patriots (27)</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Kareem Hunt fumbled on his first NFL snap. He proceeded to follow that up with 250 yards and 3 TD’s. He looked every bit the part of an elite three-down back on Thursday night. I don’t think he has anywhere close to a game like this again, so if someone is willing to offer you a top-5 player for him then I would take that. Other than that, enjoy the ride.
                                    <br> Mike Gillislee’s fantasy stats look great. 15 carries and 3 touchdowns seem great but I am selling Gillislee moving forward. Tom Brady did not throw a touchdown and with a healthy Gronk I don’t see much value in Gillislee weekly, especially if he’s not scoring touchdowns.
                                    <br> You could tell Tom Brady missed Julian Edelman out there on Thursday night. He did not seem to have the same rhythm that were accustomed to seeing, and until he builds a stronger rapport with Brandin Cooks I think Brady’s ceiling is a bit capped.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Jets (12) vs. Bills (21)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    This probably goes without saying, but it is going to a rough season for the Jets. I don’t want any part of that offense, especially if Forte and Powell are splitting carries. There is not enough points going around in that offense to justify either one of them.
                                    <br> LeSean McCoy did what we expected him to, and still was incredibly impressive. Amassing 110 yards on the ground and 49 through the air, he one of the safest bets to put in your lineup going forward.
                                    <br> Tyrod Taylor does not get the credit he deserves. The Bills clearly don’t view him as the franchise guy moving forward, but he is a solid fantasy QB especially in 2-QB leagues. You could do a lot worse out there at QB (yes, I’m looking at you Scott Tolzein).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Seahawks (9) vs. Packers (17)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Not the start we all expected from Russell Wilson. I am not panicking though. He still has an elite tight end in Graham and possibly the best slot receiver in Baldwin, and has notoriously had slow starts. The big games will be there, so be patient with Wilson.
                                    <br> Eddie Lacy is BAD. SO, SO, BAD. Drop him, forget him, he never existed. Eddie who? I like Chris Carson but I think It’s Rawls or bust in the Seattle backfield running behind one of the worst offensive lines in the league.
                                    <br> Ty Montgomery was very impressive on Sunday. He ran with patience, power, and more importantly was out there on all 3 downs. He could have a huge year and I am excited to watch him going forward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Falcons (23) vs. Bears (17)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tarik Cohen displayed all of the abilities that saw him emerge as a viable backup to Jordan Howard. He scored a touchdown and was explosive in both the passing and running game. He’s not a between the tackles kind of back, but in a PPR he is an interesting sleeper to pick up.
                                    <br> If Tevin Coleman does not score touchdowns like he did on Sunday, then I don’t see much value in him except as a handcuff to Devonta Freeman. He probably won’t be justifying his draft position anytime soon.
                                    <br> If you haven’t seen Austin Hooper’s 88-yard touchdown grab, please go watch it now. After you have seen that awesomeness, Hooper presents an interesting value as a sleeper tight end. The volume will likely not be there, but he could develop into a consistent big play and red zone weapon for Matt Ryan going forward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Ravens (20) vs. Bengals (0)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Well Andy Dalton, that was rough. 5 turnovers and 0 points scored is horrendous, but I think Dalton will be fine. He has always struggled against the Ravens, and his track record shows that much better days are ahead.
                                    <br> Joe Mixon was almost nonexistent in this one, and I am a bit worried about him moving forward. I don’t see Jeremy Hill going anywhere (unfortunately) and Gio Bernard will always have a role as long as he is healthy. Mixon is undoubtedly their most talented back, but if the usage is not there, you will be disappointed.
                                    <br> Danny Woodhead was looking awesome, but as he usually does, went down and out with a hamstring injury. Buck Allen stepped in with 21 carries, but I like him as a sleeper moving forward. Terrance West is not a pass catcher, and Flacco loves checking it down, so Allen could provide some great value, especially in PPR.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Steelers (21) vs. Browns (18)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    If there is a Le’Veon Bell owner in your league that is discouraged by his 47 total yard week 1 performance, try to go get him. This was a weird game that saw bell only get 10 carries. I am not worried one bit about Bell.
                                    <br> I was high on Corey Coleman’s talent coming out of Baylor, but with injuries and other players emerging, Coleman has gone under the radar the past couple of years. He seems to have a strong rapport with Kizer, and I like him as a solid flex play week in and week out going forward.
                                    <br> Duke Johnson Jr. had 2 catches for 20 yards and not much else. Crowell overwhelmingly saw the majority of carries, but did not do much with those. I think Johnson will be fine, and would look to buy low on him if he continues his slow start.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Cardinals (23) vs. Lions (35)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    With David Johnson going on IR with a dislocated wrist, I am staying away from the Cardinals offense. Palmer has been bad for about 2 years now, and with no David Johnson I expect defenses to key all in on Larry Fitzgerald. Not good times in Arizona right now.
                                    <br> Kenny Golladay was a deep sleeper amongst many experts, and rewarded those with a 4 catch, 69 yard, 2 TD day. I love Golladay’s talent, but could see some becoming too high on him. Heck of a debut though.
                                    <br> Ameer Abdullah turned 15 carries into 30 yards, good for a whopping 2.0 ypc. Not. Good. With Theo Riddick improving in health and Dwayne Washington getting goal line work, I don’t see great returns for Abdullah moving forward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Jaguars (29) vs. Texans (7)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    There was much concern about Leonard Fournette missing 3 preseason games with a foot injury, but Fournette quickly put those concerns to bed with a 100- yard rushing performance. He ran tough, shifty, and was also active in the passing game, and should have an excellent rookie season ahead. Facing the Colts and Titans twice a year helps too.
                                    <br> Man, you’ve got to feel for DeAndre Hopkins. He’s gone through about 5 QB changes in 2 years, and outside of Brian Hoyer none of them seemed to realize they have a top-5 WR talent lining up on the outside. With Deshaun Watson the presumable starter moving forward (10 targets including 3 red zone ones from Watson in the second half), I like Hopkins potential moving forward. Rookie QB’s tend to rely on their star receivers, a la Cam Newton and Steve Smith his rookie year. You never know with the Texans though, so we shall see.
                                    <br> The Jaguars defense used to be a push over, but with new addition Calais Campbell (3 sacks in the first half alone) helping to man that front 4, they are no joke. This is a tough, deep defensive unit that should be factored into when making your lineup decisions in the future.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Raiders (26) vs. Titans (16)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Corey Davis is the biggest takeaway for me from this game. He was on the field early and often, and was a favorite target for Marcus Mariota, finishing with a respectable 6 catch, 69 yard performance. He will have his down weeks forsure, but I like the rookie as a solid flex play most weeks going forward.
                                    <br> How awesome is it to have Beast Mode back? He looked great on Sunday, and should only get better as he gets back into playing shape. Playing in this high octane Raiders office, expect more touchdowns to come for Lynch.
                                    <br> DeMarco Murray was oddly quiet in this one, but I think this was an outlier. I think Tennessee establishes the run next week and Murray obviously will be the biggest beneficiary of that. No need to panic yet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Eagles (30) vs. Redskins (17)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Carson Wentz was excellent on Sunday, showing accuracy in the pocket, mobility and good arm strength against a good but not great Redskins secondary. He has a lot of options to play with, and I see a big second-year leap coming for Wentz.
                                    <br> Kirk Cousins on the other hand did not look great. He was timid in the pocket and lacked the decision making we have come to expect from Mr. You Like That! I will give it a few more weeks to get Pryor acclimated, but if he continues to struggle, the entire offense will get a downgrade.
                                    <br> Zach Ertz had 8 catches on all 8 of his targets for 93 yards, and could finally be entering into that elite class of tight ends. Start him with confidence moving forward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Colts (9) vs. Rams (46)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    With Andrew Luck still out for the foreseeable future, this Colts offense has almost no upside. I’m hesitant to start all of them right now, and that includes T.Y. Hilton who had only 3 catches for 57 yards. Try to stay away until Luck gets back.
                                    <br> Todd Gurley’s fantasy line looks pretty good (96 total yards and a Touchdown) but he only averaged 2.1 ypc on 19 carries. That concerns me. The volume will be there, but he must become more efficient to enter back into that elite running back category.
                                    <br> Jared Goff looked excellent on Sunday, throwing for 306 yards and a touchdown. I am not sold yet. He was playing against the worst defense in the league and had all day to throw. I want to see how he does over the next few weeks against the Redskins, 49ers, and Cowboys before labeling him legit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Panthers (23) vs. 49ers (3)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Christian McCaffrey was very involved as expected, but with Jonathan Stewart being the red zone and goal line back, I think McCaffrey’s value outside of PPR is a bit limited. He is supremely talented and will have some great week, but I think weeks like Sunday (85 yards on 18 touches) will unfortunately be the norm early on for the Stanford product.
                                    <br> Carlos Hyde only had 9 carries on Sunday but looked elite with them gaining 45 yards. He was also involved in the passing game, catching 6 passes for 32 yards. His improved pass catching ability should keep him on the field on all 3 downs, which should keep him active at all times moving forward. Let’s just hope Hoyer can keep them in enough games for Hyde’s full talent to go on display.
                                    <br> Pierre Garcon was his usual self, catching 6 passes for 81 yards. He should be a PPR machine with Brian Hoyer behind center, and look for these stat lines to be the norm with some touchdowns sprinkled in here and there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Giants (3) vs. Cowboys (19)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Giants need Odell Beckham back as soon as possible. Eli looked lost without him on Sunday night against a Cowboys defense that ranked in the bottom half against the pass last year. Not good.
                                    <br> In a tough matchup against a stout Giants rush defense, Ezekiel Elliott was as solid as ever (24 carries, 104 yards, 5 catches 36 yards). As long as he is out there he is as elite as they come against any defense. Let’s just hope he is able to play all year.
                                    <br> Evan Engram was the lone bright spot on a tough night for the Giants, catching 4 passes for 50 yards in his debut. He should be a constant target for Eli Manning moving forward, and could become a top-10 tight end by years end.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Saints (19) vs. Vikings (29) </strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Stefon Diggs (7 catches, 93 yards) and Adam Thielen (9 catches, 157 yards) were tremendous on Monday night for the Vikings, and should provide great weekly value as long as Bradford is behind center.
                                    <br> Dalvin Cook was excellent in his first game in the NFL. He looked explosive rushing for 127 yards and should become more involved in the passing game as the season moves along. I love him for the rest of the year.
                                    <br> That Saints backfield on the other hand, yikes. Rookie Alvin Kamara led the team in carries with 7, Mark Ingram was active in the passing game during garbage time, and Adrian Peterson was busy arguing with Sean Payton on the sideline about getting the ball more. This is not a good situation in New Orleans, and I am not confident starting any of them at the moment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Chargers (21) vs. Broncos (24)</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    As long as Trevor Siemian is behind center for the Broncos, both Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders are high-end WR 3’s at best. Their talent is much higher than that, but with Siemian crossing 200 yards passing rarely, the numbers just won’t be there for the duo.
                                    <br> Keenan Allen only caught 5 of his 10 targets for 35 yards and a touchdown. Better days are ahead for Allen as the Broncos are one of the best defenses against the pass, and I still see a big season coming from the Cal product.
                                    <br> C.J. Anderson doubled Jamaal Charles’ carries, and appears to be the guy. He ran well amassing 81 yards on 20 carries. With limited touchdown opportunities playing in that Denver Broncos offense, I like Anderson more as a high-end flex than RB2 at the moment.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>TNF Fantasy Preview: Chiefs vs. Patriots</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                     The defending Super Bowl champion Patriots hosting the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday night. As any avid fantasy football player understands, your work is not done just because you have drafted your team and week 1 has arrived. It is now time to look at the waiver wire, trades, and sleepers while everyone else just sits back and relax. This article will help aid you in making those tough week 1 decisions as you try to get your fantasy championship run started. There are obviously many fantasy relevant players on both sides of this opening Thursday Night Football tilt, and we here at the Fantasy Fuss want to help you with those difficult start/sit decisions along with baseline stat projections to support them. With that, let’s get started.</p>
                                <p>
                                </p><strong>Good Matchups</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Kareem Hunt Some of you might be thinking rookie running back in his first start on primetime against the defending champs? No thanks. But, with Spencer Ware out for what is likely the season, this is Hunt’s job. A talented runner who has displayed patience all preseason long, I see a good game coming from Hunt. He should be in on all 3 downs as he has exhibited excellent pass catching ability. The Patriots allowed 4.0 YPC to running backs last year, so they can be run on. I expect some good runs coming from Hunt, and with Alex Smith at QB I project some screens and check downs to help pad those stats for Hunt. Don’t be scared off of starting the rookie on Thursday night. Stat Projection: 22 rush, 85 yards; 4 receptions, 25 yards; 0.5 TD’s. Mike Gillislee Kansas City’s overall defense gets a lot more credit than it deserves. They finished in the bottom half against the run, and I think Gillislee has big touchdown potential here in week 1. The Patriots have historically had good scoring days in week 1 Thursday night games (28 points in 2015 vs. Steelers), and Gillislee should get all of the early downs and goal line work. As Legarrette Blount displayed last year, there will be plenty of goal line opportunities coming for Gillislee. He is definitely more talented than Blount, and has looked great in the limited preseason action he has seen. Start Gillislee with confidence week 1 and bank on a touchdown from the University of Florida product. Stat Projection: 18 rush, 70 yards; 2 receptions, 10 yards; 0.9 TD’s Brandin Cooks All reports this preseason are that Cooks is looking great and has built a strong rapport with Tom Brady already. Cooks should be the biggest beneficiary from the unfortunate season-ending injury to Julian Edelman, and Brady should look his way early and often. Cooks has top-5 WR upside in week 1 against the supremely overrated defense of the Kansas City Chiefs. Stat Projection: 6 catches, 85 yards; 0.7 TD’s</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Not So Good Matchups</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Travis Kelce The Patriots only allowed 6.2 ppg to tight ends in 2016, and that trend should continue into the 2017 season. Kelce is the most proven option in that Chiefs offense, and Belichick will likely key in on him in week 1. With Alex Smith at QB I foresee a conservative game plan coming which does not appease Kelce’s supreme down the field ability. You probably don’t have a much better option at tight end given the lack of talent at the position, but you need to temper your expectations for Kelce in week 1. Stat Projection: 5 catches, 50 yards; 0.3 TD’s Danny Amendola Amendola has seen his stock rise significantly Julian Edelman out. Many view him as the guy who will slide in and occupy that role, but I don’t see it that way. Amendola has never been a volume receiver, and in an offense where he is still at best the 4th option in the passing game I don’t foresee great production. Brady has a healthy Gronk, new weapon in Cooks, and an emerging Chris Hogan, which leaves Amendola likely next. The Chiefs were susceptible to downfield throws in 2016, and Brady should exploit that. That is not Amendola’s specialty, and the volume will likely not be there to justify starting him even in your flex. Proceed with caution on Amendola. Stat Projection: 4 catches, 45 yards; 0.2 TD’s</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Sleeper Pick</strong> </p>
                                <p>
                                    Chris Hogan As referenced above with Amendola, Hogan has a prime opportunity with the injury to Julian Edelman. We saw just what Hogan can do in preseason week 3 where he caught two touchdowns and was a consistent downfield target for Brady. The Chiefs should give up some big plays on Thursday night, and Hogan could be the biggest beneficiary of that. While not a volume receiver himself, Hogan’s downfield ability combined with the opportunity make him an intriguing flex play. Consider Hogan for the big play touchdown upside in week 1. Stat Projection: 4 catches, 80 yards; 0.7 TD’s</p>
