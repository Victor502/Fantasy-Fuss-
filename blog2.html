                        <h3> The Zero RB / RB Backfield Strategy</h3>
                        <p> July 27, 2017 Taylor Casey</p>

                        <p>
                            There are many different strategies to consider when it comes to fantasy football and drafting a competitive team. Strategies have a wide variance from zero wr, early qb, best available, and one of my personal favorites that we will cover today and that is the zero rb strategy. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exampleAccordion" data-children=".item">

                                    <p>While you may not win your fantasy league at the draft you can definitely lose it if you don’t know what you’re doing. Depending on where you draft is also a main factor in considering how you’re going to draft, and with this strategy you want to draft anywhere from picks 6 -12 this year. This strategy is one of my favorites this year and its mainly because everybody is in love with running backs…… and they’re absolutely getting robbed paying that much!</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In most fantasy leagues you are only required to start 2 RB’s 3 WR’s and FLEX so why would you waste an early pick on a position that you can plug in play. Now I’m not telling you to pass on any of the big three RB’s, if they’re available don’t hesitate and grab them, but after the top 3 backs are off the board the decline in talent is too much for me to risk a 1st rd pick on them. That’s why THIS YEAR you need to definitely draft wide receivers early and often.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        What exactly is the zero running back strategy? It is exactly what it sounds like! With this strategy you want to avoid running back for the first 3-4 rounds of the draft possibly even longer depending who’s left on the draft board. So if you apply this strategy and say you can grab AJ Green at the 9th pick and then come back and grab T.Y. Hilton, Michael Thomas, or Amari Cooper the 2nd round? I’ll take that all day over drafting someone like Melvin Gordon (who is one of my busts this year) or Jordan Howard who is another bust candidate. Then in the 3rd round you can grab someone like Demaryius Thomas, Keenan Allen, or Jarvis Landry who in ppr will outscore RB’s going around that same value, that’s a no brainer to me. If you’re starting your draft off this way I like your chances of being a top contender in your league.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now another strategy to employ when you are using the ZERO RB is the team backfield strategy which is the strategy I use. It is just as it sounds, when you start your draft off in the first 4 rounds and you’ve taken your 4 stud WR’s it is now time to start grabbing RB’s and you want to grab backfields such as like New England, Detroit, Cincinnati, New Orleans, Seattle, Broncos, and Redskins. When you grab a backfield you’re basically grabbing all the fantasy points that will come from those backs and you want to target good offenses with points to be had like the teas I named earlier. So what you would hypothetically would do is grab Mike Gillislee in the 5th rd, then grab James White in the 9th rd, then take a shot on someone like Dion Lewis or Rex Burkhead in the last rd. Below is a list of backfields to grab and the average of where they’re being selected.</p>

                            Every year, fantasy football players turn away from logic and projections to fall in love with a potential breakout star. Some take these “potential stars” as early as the 3rd round, while others wait until after the 6th to take their stab.

                                <p>Wherever you take your Potential Star, you are turning your head to realistic projections and dreaming of something bigger and better for the player. Below, is one of our Breakout Candidates for the 2017 Season. Stay tuned weekly for player profiles such as these!</p>
                                <p>
                                    Yes, he’s a rookie. Yes, he seems to be prone to injury. Yes, he’s in a crowded situation.. However, John Ross is a polarizing talent worthy of top tier fantasy football consideration. He is currently coming off the board in the mid to late 11th round and the 57th WR taken. Ross broke a combine record in the 40 yard dash with his blazing time of 4.22. Most think of Ross as a downfield one trick pony, yet he is much more rounded. Some scouts had him as the top WR coming into the draft. Our favorite quote from a scout about Ross was “Most people think he can just burn, but he can stop too”. Being able to stop is everything in the NFL. Ross is able to stop on a dime and create enough separation to get open and break HUGE gains for his team with the ball in his hands. Scouts said he may be the best route runner in the draft other than Corey Davis and is definitely the best at creating separation.
                                    <p> John Ross will find himself trying to create separation between him and his fellow WR’s in training camp and has a chance to be AJ Green’s top running mate. If he does, he could find himself in WR2 or 3 territory. For the last 4 seasons, AJ Green’s running mate has averaged; 97 Targets, 59 catches, 795 yards receiving, and 6 touchdowns. That stat line unchanged would have ranked 40th overall for WR just under Desean Jackson, Sterling Shepard, and Cameron Meredith to name a few. </p>
                                    <p>All of which were fantastic WR3’s throughout the season in PPR leagues. We think John Ross can surpass the 4 year average of AJ Green’s running mate. With his speed, route running, ability to create separation, and his playmaking skills after the catch… John Ross can be Brandin Cooks esque this year. If John Ross gets the nod for AJ’s top running mate, we could see him in the WR2 territory. Our projections have him at 69 catches, 900 yards, and 7 TD’s. That would land him smack dab in the middle of WR2 range in a PPR league. This is totally possible given the fact that Andy Dalton is a more than compatible QB, the Bengals have recommitted to the run game by drafting Mixon which will leave Ross in great 1 on 1 situations, and that AJ demands all the attention… all of the time! If Ross can stay healthy…. Watch out!
                                    </p>

                                    <p><strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> – Watson seems to be overlooked by most analyst. They will respect his pedigree but give him a mid to late round grade.. some even say he’s not a first rounder. We firmly believe in Watson, we even have him going in the top 10. There are two spots we’d love to see him land in the top 10.. the first spot is Jacksonville at 4. You may think to yourself.. why do that with Bortles there.. some may think.. thank god get Bortles out of there.. either way, Watson could thrive in Jax. The WR core lead by Allen Robinson would benefit from a change at QB and Watson has the arm to showcase A Rob’s talent! The second would be a proposed trade by the Cardinals jumping up into the top 10 or 11 and taking Watson before the Browns could at 12. Bruce Arians would love to sit Watson behind Palmer this year and let him learn. Palmer will likely retire soon and Watson could be his replacement.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Corey Davis</strong> – Davis has been touted as the most NFL ready receiver in this draft. With a size comparison to that of an AJ Green and foot speed to match, Davis could be in for a big year if given the right situation. His frame alone will make him a red zone / end zone target right out of the gate! Ideal fits for fantasy purposes are – Titans, Bills, Chargers, and Cardinals. I would personally like to see him go to the Cardinals!</p>
                                    <p><strong>Mike Williams</strong> – He’s not the fastest guy in the world and he doesn’t jump out of the gym.. but he has elite ball skills and is an instant red zone/end zone target for any team in the NFL. Ideal spots for Williams looks to be the Titans at 5, Chargers at 7, Bills at 10, or Cardinals at 13. Our best educated guess is that he goes to the Bills to play alongside Sammy Watkins. Williams would bring much-needed talent to a depleted WR core and would help Watkins be more productive. In the Bills offense, Williams could lead the teams WR’s in TD’s year one! For fantasy purposes… I would love to see him go the Bills or the Titans.</p>
                                    <p><strong>John Ross</strong> – Ross is a burner… yet he does more. He has been compared to D Jax and I like that comparison.. however, I think he can be a bit more than just a D Jax type of burner. Ross will likely end up with a team in the first round. He has been pegged as a mid to late first round draft pick. A lot of people have linked Ross with the Ravens, which isn’t a bad fit at all! I would love to see Ross land in Baltimore or Washington.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Leonard Fournette</strong> – Drawing comparisons to AP, Fournette is the clear-cut favorite to be the first RB off the board come draft day. Early picks with RB needs are Jacksonville at 4, and Carolina at 8. Either of these two teams in the top 10 would be a great fit for the LSU star. For fantasy purposes, Carolina seems to be the best option. He would provide a tremendous amount of talent to a team in desperate need of another playmaker other than Cam Newton. He would likely split carries with Jonathan Stewart, with a great chance of beating him out early in the season, for lead back duties. No matter where he goes, Fournette is a top 2 Dynasty pick and draftable in rounds 3-5 regardless of his landing spot in redraft leagues.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Christian McCaffrey </strong>– This guy can do it all. He impressed in the combine and at his pro day and likely helped his stock! He has been viewed as a mid to late round pick, yet is rumored to be a top 10 pick in the draft. Ideal fits for fantasy purposes would be – Colts, Jags, Bucs, and even the Saints. Our pick would be the Bucs, who are in need of a RB presence with the news of Doug Martin emerging. Doug Martin could be cut and that would leave the team with Charles Simms and Peyton Barber.. which we could see McCaffrey taking over quickly!</p>
                                    <p><strong>Dalvin Cook</strong> – Cook may be the most overrated running back in the class if you just look at his measurable’s. Yet, the tape says otherwise. It is important to note that 40 running backs have completed the three cone drill with a 7.29 second time or worse.. the only successful starter to do so out of the 40 is Demarco Murray. This obviously is just a drill and may not translate to the field 100% but it’s worth noting. Cooks potential landing spots include the Panthers, Bucs, Colts, and the Redskins. We’d love to see him land in Washington! For fantasy purposes, this would be the ideal spot for him. Kirk is playing at such a high level with little talent around him other than Jordan Reed. A guy like Cook could boost Kirk to the next level. Cook can catch passes and run downhill.. we could see him taking over Fat Rob and company day 1!</p>
                                    <p><strong>Joe Mixon</strong> – He’s been the center of adversity this year after a video released of him punching a woman in 2015.. yet, he may be the most talented Running Back in this entire class. He will likely slide down the board because of his wrong doing but his landing spots may be better because of it! We’d love to see Mixon drafted by the Bengals at 2.09!! Mixon would immediately compete for playing time behind Gio and Jeremy Hill. Hill has been disappointing for the last two years and the Bengals may not extend his rookie deal that expires in 2018. With Hill out of the picture.. Mixon could dominate carries leaving Gio to do what he does best.. catch the ball and make defenders miss in space on 3rd down!</p>

                                    <p><strong>O.J. Howard</strong> – This guy is crazy talented. He has elite speed at the TE position and the size / ability to Block. Howard has been rumored to go as high as top 5 and as late as 15-20. I think he will end up with the Broncos at 20. It isn’t really a glaring need for the Broncos but they could use a talent like Howard every single down. Whether it be blocking, taking a screen which OC McCoy loves to do, or play in the middle of the field and create space for whoever the starting QB is. Bottom line is, wherever he goes.. he is going to make an impact very quickly.</p>
